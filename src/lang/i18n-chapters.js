    0:`In 1955, Henry Rowan faces a critical crisis at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. His young company, Inductotherm, has installed six new furnaces, but the maintenance crew complains that changing the power cables takes too long. To save the contract and his reputation, Rowan accepts a dangerous wager: he bets he can change the cables on a fully hot furnace in under ten minutes. This scene illustrates Rowan’s engineering prowess and willingness to take risks. He succeeds, proving his design is superior to the industry standard, and secures the Mint's acceptance, marking a turning point for his fledging company.`,
    1:`Rowan recounts his early life, shaped by the abrupt departure of his father when Henry was six. Raised by a strong-willed mother who lost her family fortune in the 1929 crash, Rowan learns the values of frugality and self-reliance. He displays early entrepreneurial spirit by raising chickens. He attends MIT, then joins the Army Air Corps after Pearl Harbor, becoming a bomber pilot. The chapter covers his marriage to Betty and his eventual reconnection with his estranged father. This reconciliation provides closure, allowing Rowan to move forward with a drive to prove his worth to the world.`,
    2:`After World War II, Rowan returns to MIT with his wife, Betty. They live on a meager budget of $135 a month, raising two children in cramped student housing. Rowan embraces the grueling academic workload, learning to solve complex engineering problems that go beyond textbook theory. He develops a deep appreciation for the economics of engineering. Despite graduating with high honors in 1947, he is rejected by Phi Beta Kappa for not being "well-rounded." He joins Ajax Electrothermic, drawn to the company’s potential in induction melting and its location near his father’s home.`,
    3:`At Ajax, Rowan initially dislikes sales but thrives in field service, troubleshooting furnace problems. He realizes that Ajax, though an industry pioneer, has become complacent and is losing ground to competitors. Rowan proposes innovations, such as using capacitors instead of expensive synchronous motors, but shortsighted management rejects his ideas. Frustrated by corporate inertia, he channels his energy into building his own concrete home by hand. During this project, he hires a local teenager, Jess Cartlidge, beginning a lifelong professional relationship. Rowan’s dissatisfaction with Ajax grows as he sees clear opportunities for technological advancement being ignored.`,
    4:`This brief, emotionally charged chapter details a personal tragedy. While reading a Reader's Digest article about Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Rowan recognizes the symptoms described in the text in his own young son, Jimmy. Medical consultations confirm the devastating diagnosis: a progressive, fatal muscle-wasting disease with no known cure. The tragedy is compounded when his third child, David, is born and subsequently diagnosed with the same affliction. Faced with the reality that his sons will suffer progressive paralysis and early death, Rowan and Betty resolve to endure and make their children's shortened lives as fulfilling as possible.`,
    5:`Work becomes Rowan’s escape from the grief of his sons’ illness. At Ajax, he is finally transferred to the engineering department but clashes with the new president, Dean Meyer, over innovation and efficiency. Rowan hopes for the Assistant Chief Engineer position, feeling he has earned it through dedication and skill. However, Ajax hires an outsider for the role. Feeling his path to advancement is blocked and his contributions are undervalued, Rowan resigns on principle. Despite having a family to support and no immediate job lined up, he leaves Ajax in 1953, supported by Betty’s unwavering confidence.`,
    6:`After a brief stint turning around a marine hardware factory, Rowan receives a call from Paul Foley, a former customer. Foley proposes they start an induction business. In 1953, Inductotherm is incorporated. Working evenings in his garage, Rowan builds the company's first 60-pound furnace for Foley. The furnace is a success. By 1954, Rowan commits to Inductotherm full-time, selling his house to capitalize the company. Operating out of a dusty corner of Foley’s shop with a $10 filing cabinet and second-hand tools, Rowan rehires Jess Cartlidge. Together, they face the daunting task of competing against the established giant, Ajax.`,
    7:`Inductotherm struggles to survive in its infancy. They lose a critical bid for Sorenson Industries to Ajax, leading partner Paul Foley to suggest closing the business. Rowan refuses to quit. A breakthrough comes with a small order from General Electric, followed by the U.S. Mint contract. Sorenson eventually returns, offering Inductotherm another chance. To build this large system, Rowan needs capital, but banks refuse him. He secures components on credit, personally guaranteeing the debt. The Sorenson installation is a technical and financial success, establishing Inductotherm’s credibility. Despite growing sales, tensions rise between Rowan’s drive and Foley’s caution.`,
    8:`Inductotherm outgrows its corner in Foley’s shop. Betty locates a new facility in Delanco, New Jersey. As the company expands, the divergence between Rowan’s aggressive ambition and Foley’s desire for stability becomes untenable. In 1956, Foley offers to sell his share. Although the asking price is steep for the young company, Rowan agrees to a leveraged buyout, becoming the sole owner. He begins assembling a loyal team, hiring former Ajax colleagues like Dick Walker. The company culture solidifies around hard work, frugality, and rapid response to customer needs. Rowan feels the weight of sole responsibility but is exhilarated by the freedom.`,
    9:`Rowan cultivates a corporate culture of urgency, believing that crisis drives progress. When a fire disables a customer’s plant (Specialloy), Inductotherm builds a complex control panel in just four days, cementing a reputation for unmatched service. Key personnel join the team, including Tom Pippitt in purchasing and Roy Ruble in sales. Ruble challenges Rowan on pricing, arguing they should charge for value, not just cost. To bond the growing workforce to the company’s success, Rowan establishes a Profit Sharing Trust. This innovative benefit creates a sense of ownership among employees, contrasting sharply with the "management vs. labor" mentality of competitors.`,
    10:`A furnace explosion at Crucible Steel provides a major opportunity. Rowan flies his newly acquired Ercoupe to the site immediately, beating competitors. He proposes a radical engineering solution: replacing a complex coaxial feed with flexible leads and upgrading the furnace capacity. He secures the order by promising a two-week delivery. The success of this "emergency" job positions Inductotherm as a leader in vacuum melting. Recognizing the competitive advantage of aviation, Rowan upgrades to a faster Bellanca aircraft. He uses the plane to close deals, such as one with Corning Glass, proving that mobility and speed are essential to Inductotherm’s strategy.`,
    11:`Tragedy strikes the company when sales manager Jerry Wollaston is critically injured in a car crash. Simultaneously, the emotional toll of his sons’ deteriorating health weighs heavily on Rowan. He attempts to bury his grief in work, micromanaging every aspect of the booming business until he reaches a breaking point. Suffering a near-breakdown at his desk, he heeds Betty’s advice and calls his key managers—Ruble, Walker, Kennedy, and Cartlidge—together. He admits he can no longer carry the load alone. The team steps up, taking on greater responsibility. This forced delegation marks a maturation point for the company, allowing it to scale up.`,
    12:`With the team taking more responsibility, Inductotherm focuses on sales professionalism, enrolling staff in Dale Carnegie courses. To differentiate from the giant Ajax, Roy Ruble proposes a bold strategy: raising prices 10% above the competition to signal superior quality and technology. Surprisingly, the strategy works, increasing market share. Ajax retaliates with a vicious price war, openly undercutting Inductotherm on every bid. Instead of retreating, Rowan fights back, matching cuts to hold market share while relying on Inductotherm’s lower operating costs to survive. The war of attrition hurts Inductotherm’s profits but devastates the bloated Ajax, eventually leading to Ajax’s sale.`,
    13:`Ajax Electrothermic is acquired by Magnethermic. John Logan, the new owner, invites Rowan to dinner and audaciously offers him a job running the Ajax division, suggesting he simply "let Inductotherm go." Rowan refuses, amused by Logan’s underestimation of his company. However, a real threat emerges: Ajax introduces the "Multiductor," a static frequency multiplier (180 cycles) that eliminates the need for motor-generators. Customers begin choosing this new technology over Inductotherm’s motor-generator systems. Rowan realizes that to survive, Inductotherm must develop its own static frequency multiplier immediately, despite having no experience with the technology. To bridge the gap, they introduce a furnace rental program.`,
    14:`The consolidation of Ajax and Magnethermic alienates key talent, benefiting Inductotherm. Ted Kennedy, the engineering genius Rowan once admired at Ajax, is fired by Logan and eventually joins Inductotherm, bringing immense theoretical knowledge. Additionally, Jim Hoff and Al Coley, experts in channel furnaces, refuse to relocate to Ohio. Rowan finances them to start a subsidiary, Inductotherm Linemelt, to build large channel furnaces. This move diversifies Inductotherm’s product line. Hoff immediately challenges industry limitations, building higher-powered units than theoretically thought possible. This influx of talent positions the company to tackle the technical challenges posed by the Multiductor.`,
    15:`Desperate to compete with the Multiductor, Rowan hires Larry Hayes, who claims to know the technology. Rowan bets the company on a six-week deadline to build a 500kW "Tri-Line" system for Seaway Nickel. Hayes turns out to be a fraud with stolen plans. Rowan and Ted Kennedy frantically engineer the system from scratch using basic physics. They meet the deadline, and the Tri-Line works. However, Ajax threatens a patent lawsuit over the "chokes" used in the circuit. Rather than yield or pay royalties, Inductotherm engineers a superior toroidal core design that bypasses the patent, securing their leadership in 180-cycle melting.`,
    16:`By 1960, Inductotherm has outgrown its Delanco plant. Rowan purchases a 90-acre farm in Rancocas to build a modern facility complete with an airstrip. The expansion strains finances. Suddenly, the bank calls a $500,000 loan, demanding immediate repayment due to a technicality regarding short-term funds used for leasing. Facing a cash crisis, Rowan and Ruble rally by converting lease customers into buyers, offering them ownership of their furnaces. They raise the cash to pay off the bank in record time. The experience solidifies Rowan’s distrust of banks and reinforces his philosophy of financial independence. The move to Rancocas sets the stage for massive growth.`,
    17:`Rowan meets J Wooding, a brilliant but eccentric British engineer fired from Allegheny Ludlum. They form a joint venture, Consarc, to enter the vacuum-arc melting market, essential for aerospace alloys. Rowan makes a critical error by granting Wooding 50% ownership. While Consarc becomes technically successful, Wooding’s behavior becomes increasingly erratic and extravagant. He demands perks, clashes with treasurer Bob Hotchkin, and alienates customers with his arrogance. Wooding’s spending and management style clash violently with Inductotherm’s culture of frugality. The partnership deteriorates into a power struggle, teaching Rowan a hard lesson about shared control and the importance of character in business partners.`,
    18:`Inductotherm grows rapidly in the 1960s, with sales reaching $15 million by 1967. Aviation becomes central to the business culture, with sales and service staff flying company planes to reach customers quickly. Rowan hires Julia Greenhalgh, a professional secretary who finally brings order to his chaotic office. The growing company attracts union organizers. Facing an election, Rowan fights back not with threats, but by communicating the value of the company’s unique culture and the Profit Sharing Trust. The employees vote overwhelmingly against the union (2.4 to 1), valuing their direct relationship with management. This victory reinforces the "Inductotherm family" spirit.`,
    19:`Environmental regulations doom the coke-fired cupola, forcing iron foundries to switch to induction melting. Swiss giant Brown Boveri dominates this market with large 60-cycle furnaces. Inductotherm struggles to compete until Ted Kennedy invents the "Unicoil," allowing for stepless power control using toroidal reactors. This innovation helps them capture the iron market. Later, the new U.S. Mint project is designed by consultants favoring Brown Boveri’s specs. Inductotherm wins the bid but is forced to build to the flawed design. When the furnaces fail as Rowan predicted, he rebuilds them with his own design, proving Inductotherm’s technical superiority to the government.`,
    20:`With cash reserves growing, Rowan diversifies Inductotherm Industries. His strategy is to acquire small, entrepreneurial companies and fuel their growth with capital, rather than managing them as a traditional conglomerate. He acquires Pemberton Fabricators (steel), Valley Metals (supply), and others based on the owners' desire to join the group. He buys Cragmet (vacuum melting) and acquires the colorful Jimmy Metcalf. He also buys IPE (induction heating), later known as Inductoheat. The goal is to keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive in each subsidiary. Rowan realizes that specialization works better than centralization. This period marks the transition from a single furnace company to a diverse industrial group.`,
    21:`Solid-state electronics (SCRs) begin to replace motor-generators. Lacking in-house expertise, Inductotherm partners with Pillar to build the "VIP" inverter. It’s a massive success, rendering M-G sets obsolete. However, Pillar betrays the exclusive agreement, selling to competitors. Rowan breaks with Pillar and tasks Byron Taylor (from subsidiary IPE) to develop an in-house inverter. Taylor succeeds with the Mark II and later the "Power-Trak," which offers superior efficiency and "fuseless" reliability. This move secures Inductotherm’s independence and leadership in the solid-state era, leaving Pillar and others behind. This technological shift cements Inductotherm's dominance.`,
    22:`In August 1968, the long-anticipated tragedy strikes. Rowan receives a call that his son Jimmy is dying. He flies north to Lake George to be with his family, but Jimmy passes away at age twenty-one before he arrives. The grief is profound. Rowan reflects on his son’s courage and the potential cut short by the disease. The loss reinforces Rowan’s tendency to immerse himself in work as a coping mechanism, driving the company even harder as a way to outrun the pain of his personal loss. It is a somber reminder that business success cannot cure personal heartbreak.`,
    23:`Inductotherm pushes aggressively into international markets. Jess Cartlidge is sent to Australia to start a subsidiary from scratch. He dominates the local market by offering superior service and manufacturing locally. The company also expands into Mexico and Brazil. The Brazilian venture initially falters due to a poor partner who spent advances on frivolities, but Hank Raufer is sent in to turn it around. Raufer instills Inductotherm’s culture of hard work and integrity, making the Brazilian subsidiary a success. This era establishes Inductotherm as a true multinational entity, willing to export its unique corporate culture along with its technology.`,
    24:`The British subsidiary, Metalectric, is hemorrhaging money due to poor management and class-based friction between management and labor. Rowan fires the managing director for unethical behavior and sends Jess Cartlidge from Australia to the UK. Jess dismantles the class barriers, rolling up his sleeves in the shop and drinking with workers at the local pub. He renames the company Inductotherm Europe and instills a spirit of teamwork. The turnaround is spectacular. The company becomes highly profitable and receives the prestigious Queen’s Award to Industry. Jess’s success proves that the Inductotherm philosophy can transcend cultural boundaries.`,
    25:`Rowan worries that success is breeding complacency. The crisis with Pillar (who began selling directly to competitors) provides the necessary shock. Inductotherm is forced to develop its own solid-state technology immediately. Byron Taylor, at the IPE subsidiary, had previously developed a "Shazaam" inverter on a shoestring budget to save his own job. Rowan brings Taylor to Rancocas to design a melting inverter. The resulting Mark II and later Power-Trak units are technological leaps forward, improving efficiency to 95%. The crisis revitalizes the company, proving they can still react with speed and innovation. The break with Pillar ultimately makes Inductotherm stronger.`,
    26:`The situation with J Wooding at Consarc becomes intolerable. Wooding’s ego, extravagance, and litigious nature threaten to destroy the company. He alienates customers, sues imaginary enemies, and abuses staff. Rowan finally maneuvers to take majority control (55%) to save the subsidiary from bankruptcy. In a dramatic board meeting involving priests and lawyers, Wooding is ousted. Wooding sues, leading to a drawn-out legal battle, but the court ultimately upholds the buyout formula. With Wooding gone, Stan Myers takes over, restoring stability and profitability to Consarc. The "exorcism" removes a toxic influence, allowing the subsidiary to flourish again.`,
    27:`Rowan pays tribute to Roy Ruble, his long-time right-hand man and President of Inductotherm Corp. Ruble’s disciplined management, integrity, and pricing strategies were pivotal to the company’s growth. He was a master negotiator and mentor to the sales team. Tragically, Ruble dies of cancer in 1984. To succeed him, Ruble had groomed John Mortimer, the former head of Inductotherm Australia. Mortimer brings a different, more accessible management style—installing air conditioning in the shop and removing barriers between management and staff. Supported by Paul Cervellero in sales, Mortimer continues the company’s growth. Rowan steps back to run the holding company, trusting the new leadership.`,
    28:`Inductotherm Industries accelerates its acquisition strategy, buying diverse companies like Magnetic Metals, Vantage Products, and Lepel. Rowan manages this empire using a system of transparent financial charts to monitor vital signs. While most acquisitions prosper, some require intervention. Jerry Ciccone of SMS is fired for embezzlement and later jailed. At IPE (later Inductoheat), Byron Taylor replaces Bill Peschel, who could not make a profit. Taylor cuts bureaucracy, creates a results-oriented culture, and utilizes corporate aircraft to boost sales. Under Taylor, Inductoheat becomes a world leader. The holding company grows into a conglomerate, but retains its focus on entrepreneurial autonomy.`,
    29:`Jess Cartlidge takes on his final and toughest assignment: establishing Inductotherm Japan. Facing immense costs ($4,000/month rent for a house) and a closed business culture, Jess perseveres. He learns Japanese and dons work clothes to train his staff, breaking cultural norms. Domestic competitors like Mitsubishi and Shinko Denki slash prices to drive him out. However, Inductotherm’s superior technology (Power-Trak) and service eventually win over the market. Mitsubishi eventually exits the furnace business, and Inductotherm Japan becomes a major player. This victory in the "lion’s den" of Asian manufacturing completes Inductotherm’s global dominance.`,
    30:`In December 1978, tragedy strikes again. Rowan’s second son, David, passes away at age 28 from muscular dystrophy. Despite his physical confinement to a wheelchair, David had lived an intellectually rich life, painting, building electronics, and engaging the world via CB radio. The loss is devastating to the family. Coming a decade after Jimmy’s death, it marks the end of a long, painful struggle against the disease. The event underscores for Rowan that while business success is rewarding, it cannot protect against the deepest personal losses.`,
    31:`Rowan eyes the vast potential of India. Early direct sales are plagued by bureaucracy and corruption, which Inductotherm refuses to engage in. A former agent, Kumar Harve, betrays them for a competitor. Finally, Rowan meets Kishore Vyas, an Indian engineer who had copied Inductotherm’s designs to build his own company. Impressed by Vyas’s integrity and tenacity, Rowan forms a joint venture, Inductotherm India. Despite government restrictions, the venture succeeds by maintaining high ethical standards and introducing modern technology. The company helps modernize India’s foundry industry, producing basic goods like stainless steel flatware for the population.`,
    32:`Rowan reflects on the risks and complexities of global expansion. Without a master plan, Inductotherm became the world's largest furnace manufacturer by acting decisively. However, success brings new dangers, specifically political ones. This chapter serves as a prelude to the major geopolitical conflicts involving Consarc. It details how Consarc, led by Jimmy Metcalf, sold vacuum furnaces to the Soviet Union. While initially approved, the deal became controversial when intelligence agencies suspected the furnaces were for making "carbon-carbon" nose cones for missiles. Rowan eventually ordered Metcalf to stop work on the project, leading to Metcalf's resignation.`,
    33:`Consarc secures a contract to sell electron-beam furnaces to Iraq for medical prosthetics. The U.S. Commerce Department approves the sale. However, as the geopolitical climate shifts prior to the Gulf War, the White House blocks the shipment, fearing nuclear applications. The media brands Consarc as "technobandits." Rowan is furious at the government's flip-flopping and the media's distortion. He sues the Iraqi government for breach of contract and wins a massive judgment (though uncollectible). The incident highlights the perils of high-tech exports and leaves Rowan bitter about the government's handling of legitimate business deals, although Consarc eventually retains the down payment.`,
    34:`In 1990, fundraiser Phil Tumminia approaches Rowan for a donation to Glassboro State College. Rowan initially gives a token $1,500 but strikes up a friendship with Tumminia. Tumminia asks for a library donation; Rowan refuses, interested only in engineering education. Eventually, Tumminia asks hypothetically what the college would do with $100 million. Rowan, looking for a new challenge and wanting to give back to New Jersey, decides to pledge $100 million to the college—the largest gift to a public institution ever. The only condition is the establishment of a top-quality engineering school. The college agrees to rename itself Rowan College.`,
    35:`The announcement of the $100 million gift creates a media frenzy. Controversy erupts: alumni sue over the name change, and unions attack the scholarship clause which excludes collective bargaining units unless negotiated. The media paints Rowan as an egotist and union-buster. Rowan holds a press conference to clarify his simple, unconditional intent: to improve education. The fervor dies down. Rowan begins transferring the funds. In the epilogue, he reflects on his life, the loss of his sons, the success of his daughter Ginny and the company, and his continued desire for challenges. The "fire within" remains unquenched.`,

    0:`1955년, 헨리 로완은 필라델피아의 미국 조폐국(U.S. Mint)에서 중대한 위기에 직면합니다. 그의 신생 기업인 인덕토썸(Inductotherm)이 6개의 새로운 용해로를 설치했으나, 유지보수팀은 전원 케이블 교체에 시간이 너무 오래 걸린다며 불만을 제기했습니다. 계약과 회사의 명성을 지키기 위해 로완은 위험한 내기를 겁니다. 그는 뜨겁게 가열된 용해로의 케이블을 10분 안에 교체하겠다고 호언장담합니다. 이 장면은 로완의 엔지니어링 능력과 위험을 감수하는 기질을 잘 보여줍니다. 결국 그는 성공하여 자신의 설계가 업계 표준보다 우수함을 입증하고 조폐국의 신뢰를 얻어내며 회사 성장의 전환점을 마련합니다.`,
    1:`로완은 6살 때 아버지가 떠나버린 후 형성된 자신의 어린 시절을 회상합니다. 1929년 대공황으로 가문의 재산을 잃은 강인한 어머니 밑에서 자란 그는 검소함과 자립심을 배웠습니다. 그는 닭을 키우며 일찍이 사업가적 기질을 보였고, MIT에 진학한 후 진주만 공습이 터지자 육군 항공대에 입대하여 폭격기 조종사가 되었습니다. 이 챕터는 아내 베티와의 결혼, 그리고 소원해졌던 아버지와의 재회를 다룹니다. 아버지와의 화해는 그에게 심리적 안정을 주었고, 세상에 자신의 가치를 증명해 보이겠다는 열정을 품고 앞으로 나아가는 계기가 되었습니다.`,
    2:`제2차 세계대전 후, 로완은 아내 베티와 함께 MIT로 돌아옵니다. 그들은 한 달에 135달러라는 적은 예산으로 비좁은 학생 기숙사에서 두 아이를 키우며 생활합니다. 로완은 혹독한 학업을 소화하며 교과서 이론을 넘어서는 복잡한 공학 문제를 해결하는 법을 배웁니다. 그는 공학의 경제적 측면에 대해서도 깊이 이해하게 됩니다. 1947년 우수한 성적으로 졸업했음에도 불구하고 '다재다능하지 않다'는 이유로 파이 베타 카파(Phi Beta Kappa) 클럽 가입은 거절당합니다. 그는 유도 용해 분야의 잠재력과 아버지 집과의 근접성을 고려하여 에이잭스 일렉트로써믹(Ajax Electrothermic)에 입사합니다.`,
    3:`에이잭스에서 로완은 처음에는 영업 업무를 싫어했지만, 용해로 문제를 해결하는 현장 서비스 업무에서는 두각을 나타냅니다. 그는 업계 선구자였던 에이잭스가 현실에 안주하며 경쟁사들에게 밀리고 있음을 깨닫습니다. 로완은 비싼 동기 전동기 대신 커패시터를 사용하는 등의 혁신안을 제안하지만, 근시안적인 경영진은 이를 거절합니다. 회사의 타성에 좌절한 그는 자신의 콘크리트 집을 직접 짓는 데 에너지를 쏟습니다. 이 과정에서 동네 청소년인 제스 카트리지(Jess Cartlidge)를 고용하게 되는데, 이는 평생의 인연으로 이어집니다. 기술적 진보의 기회를 무시하는 에이잭스에 대한 로완의 불만은 점점 커져만 갑니다.`,
    4:`이 짧지만 감정적으로 강렬한 챕터는 로완의 개인적인 비극을 다룹니다. 로완은 리더스 다이제스트에서 뒤셴 근이영양증에 관한 기사를 읽다가 자신의 어린 아들 지미에게서 같은 증상을 발견합니다. 의사와의 상담 끝에, 치료법이 없는 치명적인 진행성 근육 소모 질환이라는 진단을 받게 됩니다. 셋째 아들 데이비드마저 같은 병을 앓고 있다는 사실이 밝혀지며 비극은 더해집니다. 아들들이 점차 마비되어 일찍 세상을 떠날 것이라는 현실 앞에서, 로완과 베티는 고통을 견뎌내며 아이들의 짧은 생을 최대한 행복하게 만들어 주기로 결심합니다.`,
    5:`일은 아들들의 병으로 인한 슬픔으로부터 로완이 도피할 수 있는 수단이었습니다. 에이잭스에서 마침내 엔지니어링 부서로 발령받았지만, 그는 혁신과 효율성 문제로 신임 사장 딘 메이어와 충돌합니다. 로완은 자신의 헌신과 능력을 바탕으로 부수석 엔지니어 자리를 원했으나, 회사는 외부 인사를 채용합니다. 승진 길이 막히고 자신의 기여가 인정받지 못한다고 느낀 로완은 신념을 지키기 위해 사직합니다. 부양해야 할 가족이 있고 정해진 직장도 없었지만, 아내 베티의 변함없는 지지 속에 1953년 그는 에이잭스를 떠납니다.`,
    6:`선박 하드웨어 공장을 회생시키는 일을 잠시 맡았던 로완은 전 고객이었던 폴 폴리(Paul Foley)로부터 연락을 받습니다. 폴리는 유도 용해로 사업을 함께 시작하자고 제안합니다. 1953년 인덕토썸이 설립되었고, 로완은 저녁마다 차고에서 작업하여 폴리를 위한 첫 60파운드 용해로를 제작합니다. 이 용해로가 성공하자 1954년 로완은 집을 팔아 자본금을 마련하고 인덕토썸에 전념하기로 합니다. 폴리의 공장 한구석에서 10달러짜리 서류 캐비닛과 중고 공구로 시작한 그는 제스 카트리지를 다시 고용하고, 거대 기업 에이잭스와의 힘겨운 경쟁을 시작합니다.`,
    7:`인덕토썸은 초창기 생존을 위해 고군분투합니다. 소렌슨 인더스트리(Sorenson Industries)의 중요한 입찰 경쟁에서 에이잭스에게 패하자, 파트너인 폴 폴리는 사업을 접자고 제안합니다. 하지만 로완은 포기를 거부합니다. 제너럴 일렉트릭(GE)의 작은 주문과 미국 조폐국 계약을 따내며 돌파구를 마련하고, 소렌슨 역시 인덕토썸에 다시 기회를 줍니다. 대형 시스템 제작을 위한 자금이 필요했으나 은행 대출이 거절되자, 로완은 개인 보증을 서며 외상으로 부품을 확보합니다. 소렌슨 프로젝트는 기술적, 재정적으로 성공하며 회사의 신뢰도를 높였지만, 로완의 공격적인 성향과 폴리의 신중함 사이의 긴장은 커져만 갑니다.`,
    8:`인덕토썸은 폴리의 공장 한구석에서 더 이상 지낼 수 없을 만큼 성장합니다. 베티가 뉴저지주 델란코에 새로운 공장을 찾아냅니다. 회사가 확장됨에 따라, 로완의 공격적인 야망과 안정을 추구하는 폴리 사이의 괴리는 좁혀지지 않습니다. 1956년, 폴리는 자신의 지분을 팔겠다고 제안합니다. 신생 기업에게는 부담스러운 가격이었지만, 로완은 차입 매수(LBO)에 동의하고 단독 소유주가 됩니다. 그는 딕 워커와 같은 전 에이잭스 동료들을 영입하여 충성스러운 팀을 꾸립니다. 근면, 검소, 그리고 고객 요구에 대한 신속한 대응이라는 기업 문화가 확립됩니다. 로완은 홀로 모든 책임을 져야 한다는 부담감을 느끼면서도 자유로움에 들뜹니다.`,
    9:`로완은 위기가 발전을 이끈다는 믿음으로 긴박감이 넘치는 기업 문화를 조성합니다. 고객사(Specialloy) 공장에 화재가 발생하자, 인덕토썸은 단 4일 만에 복잡한 제어 패널을 제작해 주며 타의 추종을 불허하는 서비스 명성을 얻습니다. 구매 담당 톰 피핏과 영업 담당 로이 루블 같은 핵심 인재들도 합류합니다. 루블은 원가가 아닌 가치에 기반한 가격 책정을 주장하며 로완에게 도전합니다. 로완은 직원들을 회사의 성공과 연결하기 위해 이익 공유 신탁(Profit Sharing Trust)을 설립합니다. 이 혁신적인 복지 제도는 직원들에게 주인의식을 심어주었으며, 이는 경쟁사들의 노사 대립적 분위기와는 대조적인 것이었습니다.`,
    10:`크루시블 스틸(Crucible Steel)의 용해로 폭발 사고는 큰 기회가 됩니다. 로완은 새로 구입한 비행기(Ercoupe)를 타고 즉시 현장으로 날아가 경쟁사보다 먼저 도착합니다. 그는 복잡한 동축 케이블 대신 유연한 리드선을 사용하고 용해로 용량을 늘리는 급진적인 기술적 해결책을 제안합니다. 그는 2주 납기를 약속하며 주문을 따냅니다. 이 '긴급' 프로젝트의 성공으로 인덕토썸은 진공 용해 분야의 리더로 자리매김합니다. 항공기가 주는 경쟁우위를 깨달은 로완은 더 빠른 벨란카(Bellanca) 기종으로 업그레이드합니다. 그는 코닝 글래스와의 계약 등에서 비행기를 활용하며, 기동성과 속도가 인덕토썸 전략의 핵심임을 입증합니다.`,
    11:`영업 매니저 제리 월라스턴이 교통사고로 치명상을 입으면서 회사에 비극이 닥칩니다. 동시에 아들들의 건강 악화로 인한 정서적 고통이 로완을 짓누릅니다. 그는 슬픔을 잊기 위해 일에 매달리며 급성장하는 사업의 모든 부분을 세세하게 관리하려다 결국 한계에 부딪힙니다. 사무실에서 거의 쓰러질 뻔한 그는 베티의 조언을 받아들여 루블, 워커, 케네디, 카트리지 등 핵심 관리자들을 소집합니다. 그는 더 이상 혼자 짐을 질 수 없음을 인정합니다. 팀원들은 기꺼이 더 큰 책임을 맡으며 나섭니다. 이러한 강제적인 권한 위임은 회사가 성숙해지고 규모를 확장하는 결정적인 계기가 됩니다.`,
    12:`팀이 더 많은 책임을 맡게 되면서, 인덕토썸은 직원들을 데일 카네기 코스에 등록시키는 등 영업 전문성에 집중합니다. 거대 기업 에이잭스와 차별화하기 위해 로이 루블은 대담한 전략을 제안합니다. 바로 경쟁사보다 가격을 10% 인상하여 우수한 품질과 기술력을 과시하는 것입니다. 놀랍게도 이 전략은 적중하여 시장 점유율이 상승합니다. 에이잭스는 이에 맞서 무자비한 가격 전쟁을 선포하며 노골적으로 가격을 깎습니다. 로완은 물러서는 대신 가격 인하에 맞불을 놓아 시장 점유율을 방어하고, 낮은 운영 비용을 바탕으로 버텨냅니다. 이 소모전은 인덕토썸의 수익에 타격을 주었지만, 비대해진 에이잭스에게는 치명타가 되어 결국 에이잭스의 매각으로 이어집니다.`,
    13:`에이잭스 일렉트로써믹은 마그네써믹(Magnethermic)에 인수됩니다. 새로운 오너인 존 로건은 로완을 저녁 식사에 초대하여, 인덕토썸을 "그냥 놔두고" 에이잭스 부문을 맡아달라는 대담한 제안을 합니다. 로완은 자신의 회사를 과소평가하는 로건의 태도에 헛웃음을 지으며 거절합니다. 그러나 진짜 위협이 등장합니다. 에이잭스가 전동 발전기가 필요 없는 정지형 주파수 체배기인 "멀티덕터(Multiductor, 180사이클)"를 출시한 것입니다. 고객들이 인덕토썸의 전동 발전기 시스템 대신 이 신기술을 선택하기 시작합니다. 로완은 생존을 위해 관련 기술 경험이 전무함에도 불구하고 즉시 독자적인 정지형 주파수 체배기를 개발해야 함을 깨닫습니다. 공백을 메우기 위해 그들은 용해로 렌털 프로그램을 도입합니다.`,
    14:`에이잭스와 마그네써믹의 합병 과정에서 소외된 핵심 인재들이 인덕토썸으로 넘어오게 됩니다. 로완이 에이잭스 시절 존경했던 천재 엔지니어 테드 케네디는 로건에게 해고된 후 인덕토썸에 합류하여 방대한 이론적 지식을 전수합니다. 또한 채널 용해로 전문가인 짐 호프와 알 콜리는 오하이오로의 이전을 거부합니다. 로완은 이들에게 자금을 지원하여 대형 채널 용해로를 제작하는 자회사 '인덕토썸 라인멜트(Inductotherm Linemelt)'를 설립하게 합니다. 이는 제품 라인업을 다양화하는 계기가 됩니다. 호프는 이론적 한계를 뛰어넘는 고출력 장비를 제작하며 업계의 통념에 도전합니다. 이러한 인재 유입은 멀티덕터가 제기한 기술적 과제를 해결할 기반이 됩니다.`,
    15:`멀티덕터와 경쟁하기 위해 필사적이었던 로완은 관련 기술을 안다고 주장하는 래리 헤이즈를 고용합니다. 로완은 시웨이 니켈(Seaway Nickel)을 위해 6주 안에 500kW급 "트라이 라인(Tri-Line)" 시스템을 제작하는 프로젝트에 회사의 운명을 겁니다. 그러나 헤이즈는 훔친 도면을 가진 사기꾼임이 드러납니다. 로완과 테드 케네디는 기초 물리학을 바탕으로 밤을 새워가며 시스템을 처음부터 다시 설계합니다. 그들은 기한을 맞추고 트라이 라인은 성공적으로 작동합니다. 하지만 에이잭스는 회로에 사용된 "초크(chokes)"에 대해 특허 소송을 제기하며 위협합니다. 인덕토썸은 굴복하거나 로열티를 지불하는 대신, 특허를 우회하는 우수한 토로이달 코어 설계를 개발하여 180사이클 용해 분야의 주도권을 확보합니다.`,
    16:`1960년, 인덕토썸은 델란코 공장이 비좁을 정도로 성장합니다. 로완은 랭코카스(Rancocas)에 90에이커의 농장을 매입하여 활주로를 갖춘 현대식 시설을 짓습니다. 그러나 확장은 재정에 부담을 줍니다. 갑자기 은행이 리스 자금으로 단기 대출을 사용했다는 이유를 들어 50만 달러의 대출금 즉시 상환을 요구합니다. 자금 위기에 직면한 로완과 루블은 리스 고객들에게 용해로 소유권을 제안하며 구매자로 전환시키는 기지를 발휘합니다. 그들은 기록적인 시간 안에 자금을 모아 은행 빚을 갚습니다. 이 경험은 은행에 대한 로완의 불신을 굳히고 재정적 독립에 대한 철학을 강화하는 계기가 됩니다. 랭코카스로의 이전은 대규모 성장의 발판이 됩니다.`,
    17:`로완은 알레그니 러들럼(Allegheny Ludlum)에서 해고된 뛰어나지만 기이한 영국 엔지니어 J 우딩을 만납니다. 그들은 항공우주 합금에 필수적인 진공 아크 용해 시장에 진출하기 위해 합작 회사 콘사크(Consarc)를 설립합니다. 로완은 우딩에게 50%의 지분을 주는 치명적인 실수를 저지릅니다. 콘사크는 기술적으로 성공하지만, 우딩의 행동은 점점 더 변덕스럽고 사치스러워집니다. 그는 과도한 혜택을 요구하고 재무 담당 밥 호치킨과 충돌하며, 오만함으로 고객들을 멀어지게 합니다. 우딩의 지출과 경영 스타일은 인덕토썸의 검소한 문화와 격렬하게 충돌합니다. 파트너십은 권력 다툼으로 변질되고, 로완은 공동 경영의 위험성과 사업 파트너의 인품이 얼마나 중요한지에 대해 뼈저린 교훈을 얻습니다.`,
    18:`인덕토썸은 1960년대에 급성장하여 1967년 매출 1,500만 달러를 달성합니다. 영업 및 서비스 직원들이 회사 비행기를 타고 고객을 찾아가는 등 항공은 기업 문화의 핵심이 됩니다. 로완은 전문 비서 줄리아 그린해프를 고용하여 혼란스러웠던 사무실에 질서를 잡습니다. 회사가 성장하자 노조 조직가들이 접근합니다. 투표를 앞두고 로완은 위협 대신 회사의 독특한 문화와 이익 공유 신탁의 가치를 소통하며 맞섭니다. 직원들은 경영진과의 직접적인 관계를 소중히 여겨 압도적인 표 차(2.4 대 1)로 노조 결성을 거부합니다. 이 승리는 '인덕토썸 가족' 정신을 더욱 공고히 합니다.`,
    19:`환경 규제로 인해 코크스를 사용하는 큐폴라(cupola)가 퇴출되면서 주철 주조 공장들은 유도 용해로로 전환해야 했습니다. 스위스의 거대 기업 브라운 보베리(Brown Boveri)가 대형 60사이클 용해로 시장을 장악하고 있었습니다. 인덕토썸은 고전하다가 테드 케네디가 토로이달 리액터를 이용한 무단계 전력 제어 장치인 "유니코일(Unicoil)"을 발명하면서 반격에 나섭니다. 이 혁신으로 주철 시장을 장악하게 됩니다. 이후 새로운 미국 조폐국 프로젝트는 브라운 보베리 사양을 선호하는 컨설턴트들에 의해 설계되었습니다. 인덕토썸은 입찰을 따냈지만 결함이 있는 설계대로 제작해야만 했습니다. 로완의 예상대로 용해로가 고장 나자, 그는 자신의 설계로 다시 제작하여 정부에 인덕토썸의 기술적 우위를 입증해 보입니다.`,
    20:`현금 보유고가 늘어나자 로완은 인덕토썸 인더스트리를 다각화합니다. 그의 전략은 소규모 벤처 기업들을 인수한 뒤 전통적인 대기업 방식으로 관리하는 대신 자본을 지원해 성장을 돕는 것이었습니다. 펨버턴 패브리케이터스(철강), 밸리 메탈스(공급) 등은 소유주들이 합류를 원해 인수했습니다. 그는 크래그멧(진공 용해)을 인수하며 개성 강한 지미 멧칼프를 영입했고, IPE(유도 가열, 훗날 Inductoheat)도 사들였습니다. 목표는 각 자회사의 기업가 정신을 유지하는 것이었습니다. 로완은 중앙집권화보다 전문화가 더 효과적임을 깨닫습니다. 이 시기는 단일 용해로 회사에서 다양한 산업 그룹으로 전환하는 중요한 시점이 됩니다.`,
    21:`반도체 소자(SCR)가 전동 발전기를 대체하기 시작합니다. 자체 기술이 부족했던 인덕토썸은 필라(Pillar)와 제휴하여 "VIP" 인버터를 제작합니다. 이는 대성공을 거두며 전동 발전기를 구시대의 유물로 만듭니다. 그러나 필라는 독점 계약을 어기고 경쟁사들에게 제품을 판매하며 배신합니다. 로완은 필라와 결별하고 자회사 IPE의 바이런 테일러에게 자체 인버터 개발을 맡깁니다. 테일러는 Mark II와 이후 효율성과 "퓨즈 없는" 신뢰성을 갖춘 "파워 트랙(Power-Trak)" 개발에 성공합니다. 이로써 인덕토썸은 반도체 시대에 독립성과 리더십을 확보하게 되고, 필라와 다른 경쟁사들을 따돌리며 시장 지배력을 공고히 합니다.`,
    22:`1968년 8월, 오랫동안 예견되었던 비극이 닥칩니다. 로완은 아들 지미가 위독하다는 전화를 받습니다. 그는 가족이 있는 레이크 조지로 급히 날아가지만, 지미는 그가 도착하기 전 21살의 나이로 세상을 떠납니다. 슬픔은 깊었습니다. 로완은 아들의 용기와 병마로 인해 꺾인 잠재력을 되새깁니다. 이 상실감으로 인해 로완은 슬픔을 잊기 위해 더욱 일에 몰두하게 되고, 개인적인 고통을 이겨내려는 듯 회사를 더욱 강력하게 이끌어 나갑니다. 이는 사업적 성공도 개인적인 비극을 치유할 수는 없음을 보여주는 안타까운 순간이었습니다.`,
    23:`인덕토썸은 해외 시장으로 공격적으로 진출합니다. 제스 카트리지는 호주로 파견되어 맨바닥에서 자회사를 시작합니다. 그는 현지 생산과 탁월한 서비스를 통해 현지 시장을 장악합니다. 회사는 멕시코와 브라질로도 확장합니다. 브라질 합작 투자는 파트너가 선급금을 탕진하는 등 초기에 난항을 겪었으나, 헨크 로퍼가 파견되어 회생시킵니다. 로퍼는 근면과 성실이라는 인덕토썸의 문화를 심어 브라질 자회사를 성공시킵니다. 이 시기를 통해 인덕토썸은 기술뿐만 아니라 독특한 기업 문화까지 수출하는 진정한 다국적 기업으로 자리매김합니다.`,
    24:`영국 자회사인 메탈렉트릭(Metalectric)은 경영 부실과 노사 간 계급 갈등으로 막대한 손실을 보고 있었습니다. 로완은 비윤리적인 행위를 한 경영 이사를 해고하고 호주에 있던 제스 카트리지를 영국으로 보냅니다. 제스는 공장에서 소매를 걷어붙이고 일하고 펍에서 노동자들과 술잔을 기울이며 계급 장벽을 허 뭅니다. 그는 사명을 인덕토썸 유럽으로 변경하고 팀워크 정신을 불어넣습니다. 회생은 극적이었습니다. 회사는 높은 수익을 내게 되었고 권위 있는 '영국 여왕상(Queen’s Award to Industry)'을 수상합니다. 제스의 성공은 인덕토썸의 철학이 문화적 경계를 넘어설 수 있음을 증명했습니다.`,
    25:`로완은 성공이 안이함을 낳을까 우려합니다. 경쟁사에게 직접 판매를 시작한 필라와의 갈등은 필요한 충격 요법이 됩니다. 인덕토썸은 즉시 자체 반도체 기술을 개발해야 하는 상황에 놓입니다. 자회사 IPE의 바이런 테일러는 앞서 저예산으로 "샤잠(Shazaam)" 인버터를 개발해 자신의 자리를 지킨 바 있었습니다. 로완은 테일러를 랭코카스로 불러 용해용 인버터 설계를 맡깁니다. 그 결과 탄생한 Mark II와 이후의 파워 트랙(Power-Trak)은 효율을 95%까지 끌어올린 기술적 도약이었습니다. 이 위기는 회사에 활력을 불어넣었고, 신속하고 혁신적인 대응 능력을 입증했습니다. 필라와의 결별은 결과적으로 인덕토썸을 더 강하게 만들었습니다.`,
    26:`콘사크의 J 우딩으로 인한 상황은 더 이상 묵과할 수 없게 됩니다. 우딩의 자존심, 사치, 소송을 일삼는 성향은 회사를 파멸로 몰고 갑니다. 그는 고객을 멀어지게 하고, 가상의 적을 고소하며, 직원을 학대합니다. 로완은 파산 위기의 자회사를 구하기 위해 지분 55%를 확보하여 경영권을 장악합니다. 신부와 변호사들까지 동원된 드라마 같은 이사회에서 우딩은 축출됩니다. 우딩은 소송을 제기하여 긴 법정 공방이 이어지지만, 법원은 결국 매수 방식의 정당성을 인정합니다. 우딩이 떠난 후 스탠 마이어스가 취임하여 콘사크의 안정과 수익성을 회복시킵니다. 이 '엑소시즘'은 유해한 영향을 제거하여 자회사가 다시 번창할 수 있게 했습니다.`,
    27:`로완은 오랜 기간 자신의 오른팔이자 인덕토썸 법인 사장이었던 로이 루블에게 경의를 표합니다. 루블의 규율 있는 경영, 정직함, 가격 전략은 회사 성장의 중추적인 역할을 했습니다. 그는 탁월한 협상가이자 영업팀의 멘토였습니다. 안타깝게도 루블은 1984년 암으로 세상을 떠납니다. 후임으로 루블은 인덕토썸 호주의 대표였던 존 모티머를 지목해 두었습니다. 모티머는 공장에 에어컨을 설치하고 경영진과 직원 간의 장벽을 없애는 등 보다 개방적인 경영 스타일을 도입합니다. 영업 부문의 폴 서벨레로의 지원을 받아 모티머는 회사의 성장을 이어갑니다. 로완은 새로운 리더십을 신뢰하며 지주 회사 경영으로 물러납니다.`,
    28:`인덕토썸 인더스트리는 마그네틱 메탈스, 밴티지 프로덕츠, 레펠 등 다양한 기업을 인수하며 확장 전략을 가속화합니다. 로완은 투명한 재무 차트 시스템을 이용해 이 거대한 제국을 관리합니다. 대부분의 인수 기업이 번창했지만, 개입이 필요한 경우도 있었습니다. SMS의 제리 시코네는 횡령 혐의로 해고되어 수감되었습니다. IPE(후에 Inductoheat)에서는 수익을 내지 못하던 빌 페셸 대신 바이런 테일러가 임명되었습니다. 테일러는 관료주의를 타파하고 성과 중심 문화를 만들었으며, 기업용 항공기를 활용해 매출을 증대시켰습니다. 테일러의 지휘 아래 인덕토히트는 세계적인 리더로 성장합니다. 지주 회사는 대기업으로 성장했지만, 여전히 자율적인 기업가 정신을 중시합니다.`,
    29:`제스 카트리지는 자신의 마지막이자 가장 힘든 임무인 인덕토썸 재팬 설립을 맡습니다. 막대한 비용(월세 4,000달러)과 배타적인 비즈니스 문화에 맞서 제스는 굴하지 않습니다. 그는 일본어를 배우고 작업복을 입고 직원을 교육하며 문화적 관행을 깹니다. 미쓰비시나 신코 덴키 같은 현지 경쟁사들은 그를 몰아내기 위해 가격을 대폭 인하합니다. 그러나 인덕토썸의 우수한 기술(파워 트랙)과 서비스는 결국 시장을 사로잡습니다. 미쓰비시는 결국 용해로 사업에서 철수하고, 인덕토썸 재팬은 주요 기업으로 부상합니다. 아시아 제조업의 심장부에서 거둔 이 승리로 인덕토썸의 글로벌 지배력이 완성됩니다.`,
    30:`1978년 12월, 다시 한번 비극이 닥칩니다. 로완의 둘째 아들 데이비드가 28세의 나이로 근이영양증으로 세상을 떠납니다. 휠체어에 의지해야 했음에도 데이비드는 그림을 그리고 전자기기를 조립하며 CB 무전기로 세상과 소통하는 등 지적으로 풍요로운 삶을 살았습니다. 가족에게는 엄청난 상실이었습니다. 지미가 떠난 지 10년 만에 닥친 이 일은 병마와의 길고 고통스러웠던 싸움의 끝을 의미했습니다. 이 사건은 로완에게 사업적 성공이 보람되긴 하지만, 가장 깊은 개인적 상실까지 막아줄 수는 없음을 다시금 일깨워 주었습니다.`,
    31:`로완은 인도의 막대한 잠재력에 주목합니다. 초기의 직접 판매는 관료주의와 부패로 얼룩졌지만, 인덕토썸은 이에 타협하기를 거부합니다. 전 대리점 직원 쿠마르 하브는 경쟁사로 이직하며 회사를 배신하기도 했습니다. 마침내 로완은 인덕토썸의 설계를 모방해 자신의 회사를 차린 인도 엔지니어 키쇼어 비아스를 만납니다. 비아스의 정직함과 끈기에 감명받은 로완은 합작 투자로 인덕토썸 인디아를 설립합니다. 정부 규제에도 불구하고, 높은 윤리 기준과 현대 기술 도입을 통해 합작사는 성공을 거둡니다. 이 회사는 인도의 주조 산업 현대화를 돕고, 스테인리스 식기 같은 필수품 생산에 기여합니다.`,
    32:`로완은 글로벌 확장의 위험성과 복잡성에 대해 회고합니다. 마스터플랜은 없었지만, 결단력 있는 행동으로 인덕토썸은 세계 최대 용해로 제조업체가 되었습니다. 그러나 성공은 새로운 위험, 특히 정치적 위험을 불러왔습니다. 이 챕터는 콘사크와 관련된 주요 지정학적 갈등의 서막입니다. 지미 멧칼프가 이끄는 콘사크가 소련에 진공 용해로를 판매한 사건을 다룹니다. 초기에는 승인되었으나, 정보기관이 이 용해로가 미사일 노즈콘용 "카본-카본" 제조에 쓰일 것이라 의심하면서 논란이 됩니다. 로완은 결국 멧칼프에게 프로젝트 중단을 지시하고, 이는 멧칼프의 사임으로 이어집니다.`,
    33:`콘사크는 의료용 보철물 제작을 위해 이라크에 전자빔 용해로를 판매하는 계약을 체결합니다. 미국 상무부도 판매를 승인했습니다. 그러나 걸프전 직전 지정학적 상황이 변하면서 백악관은 핵무기 개발 우려를 이유로 선적을 막습니다. 언론은 콘사크를 "기술 도적(technobandits)"이라며 비난합니다. 로완은 정부의 말 바꾸기와 언론의 왜곡에 분노합니다. 그는 이라크 정부를 계약 위반으로 고소하여 승소 판결(실제 회수는 불가능했지만)을 받아냅니다. 이 사건은 첨단 기술 수출의 위험성을 보여주었고, 로완은 합법적 사업에 대한 정부의 처사에 씁쓸함을 느꼈지만, 콘사크는 결국 계약금을 지킬 수 있었습니다.`,
    34:`1990년, 기금 모금가 필 투미니아가 글래스보로 주립대학(Glassboro State College)에 대한 기부를 요청하며 로완에게 접근합니다. 로완은 처음에는 1,500달러라는 상징적인 금액만 기부했지만, 투미니아와 우정을 쌓게 됩니다. 투미니아가 도서관 건립 기금을 요청하자 로완은 거절하며 공학 교육에만 관심이 있다고 밝힙니다. 결국 투미니아는 1억 달러가 있다면 학교가 무엇을 할 수 있을지 가정하여 묻습니다. 새로운 도전을 찾고 뉴저지에 보답하고자 했던 로완은 공립 대학 역사상 최대 규모인 1억 달러를 기부하기로 결심합니다. 유일한 조건은 최고 수준의 공과 대학 설립이었습니다. 학교는 이에 동의하고 교명을 로완 대학(Rowan College)으로 변경하기로 합니다.`,
    35:`1억 달러 기부 발표는 언론의 뜨거운 관심을 불러일으킵니다. 그러나 논란도 뒤따릅니다. 졸업생들은 교명 변경에 대해 소송을 제기하고, 노조는 별도 협상 없이는 단체 교섭 대상자를 제외하는 장학금 조항을 공격합니다. 언론은 로완을 이기주의자이자 노조 파괴자로 묘사합니다. 로완은 기자 회견을 열어 교육 환경 개선이라는 자신의 순수하고 조건 없는 의도를 명확히 밝힙니다. 논란은 가라앉고 기금 전달이 시작됩니다. 에필로그에서 그는 자신의 삶, 아들들을 잃은 슬픔, 딸 지니와 회사의 성공, 그리고 여전히 식지 않는 도전에 대한 열망을 회고합니다. 그의 '내면의 불꽃(The Fire Within)'은 여전히 타오르고 있습니다.`,

    0:'1955年，亨利·羅文在費城美國鑄幣局面臨一場危機。他年輕的公司Inductotherm安裝了六台新熔爐，但維修人員抱怨更換電源線耗時太長。為了保住合約和自己的聲譽，羅文接受了一個危險的賭注：他打賭自己能在十分鐘內更換完一台完全發熱的熔爐上的電源線。這一幕展現了羅文卓越的工程技術和敢於冒險的精神。他最終成功了，證明自己的設計優於行業標準，並贏得了鑄幣局的認可，這標誌著他這家新創公司的轉捩點',
    1:'羅文回憶起他的早年生活，六歲時父親的突然離去深深影響了他的一生。他由一位意志堅強的母親撫養長大，母親在1929年的空難中失去了家產。羅文從小就懂得節儉和自立的價值觀。他很早就展現出創業精神，開始養雞。他進入麻省理工學院學習，珍珠港事件後加入美國陸軍航空兵，成為轟炸機飛行員。本章講述了他與貝蒂的婚姻以及最終與疏遠的父親重歸於好的故事。這次和解為羅文帶來了釋懷，也讓他能夠充滿動力地向前邁進，努力向世界證明自己的價值。',
    2:'戰結束後，羅文和妻子貝蒂回到麻省理工學院。他們每月僅靠135美元的微薄預算，在擁擠的學生宿舍裡養育兩個孩子。羅文欣然接受了繁重的學業，學會了解決超越教科書理論的複雜工程問題。他對工程經濟學有了深刻的理解。儘管1947年以優異的成績畢業，他卻因「不夠全面」而被美國大學優等生榮譽學會（Phi Beta Kappa）拒之門外。他加入了Ajax Electrothermic公司，被該公司在感應熔煉領域的潛力以及公司靠近父親家的地理位置所吸引。',
    3:'在Ajax公司，羅文起初並不喜歡銷售工作，但他卻在現場服務方面如魚得水，專門負責解決爐子故障。他意識到，Ajax雖然是產業先驅，卻變得自滿，正被競爭對手蠶食市場份額。羅文提出了一些創新方案，例如用電容器代替昂貴的同步電機，但短視的管理層卻否決了他的提議。對公司僵化的現狀感到沮喪的他，將精力投入到親手建造自己的混凝土房屋中。在這個過程中，他僱用了一位名叫傑斯·卡特里奇的當地少年，兩人由此開始了長達一生的職業合作關係。隨著羅文看到公司忽略了顯而易見的科技進步機會，他對Ajax的不滿也與日俱增。',
    4:'這短短的一章卻飽含深情，講述了一段令人心碎的個人悲劇。羅文在閱讀《讀者文摘》上一篇關於杜氏肌肉營養不良症的文章時，發現自己年幼的兒子吉米身上出現了文中描述的症狀。醫生的診斷證實了這項噩耗：一種進行性、致命的肌肉萎縮症，目前尚無治癒方法。更糟的是，他的第三個孩子大衛出生後也被診斷出患有同樣的疾病。面對兒子們將遭受進行性癱瘓和早逝的殘酷現實，羅文和貝蒂決心堅強面對，盡力讓孩子們短暫的生命過得充實而有意義。',
    5:'工作成了羅文逃避兒子生病悲痛的唯一方法。在阿賈克斯公司，他最終被調到工程部，但與新任總裁迪恩·邁耶在創新和效率問題上產生了衝突。羅文渴望晉升為助理總工程師，他認為自己憑藉奉獻和技能贏得了這個職位。然而，阿賈克斯公司卻聘請了一位外來人員擔任此職。羅文感到自己的晉升之路受阻，貢獻也未得到應有的重視，於是出於原則辭職。儘管需要養家糊口，也沒有找到下家，但在貝蒂堅定不移的支持下，他還是在1953年離開了阿賈克斯公司。',
    6:'在短暫扭轉一家船舶五金廠的頹勢後，羅文接到了老客戶保羅·弗利的電話。弗利提議他們一起創辦一家感應加熱設備公司。 1953年，感應加熱設備公司（Inductotherm）正式成立。羅文利用晚上時間在自家車庫為弗利打造了公司第一台重達60磅的爐子。這台爐子大獲成功。到了1954年，羅文全心投入感應加熱設備公司，賣掉了自己的房子來募款。他們最初在弗利店裡一個佈滿灰塵的角落辦公，用著一個價值10美元的文件櫃和一些二手工具，羅文重新聘用了傑斯·卡特里奇。他們一起面對著與產業巨頭阿賈克斯公司（Ajax）競爭的艱鉅挑戰。',
    7:'Inductotherm公司在新創階段舉步維艱。他們競標Sorenson Industries的關鍵項目時敗給了Ajax公司，導致合夥人Paul Foley建議關閉公司。 Rowan拒絕放棄。通用電氣的一筆小訂單帶來了突破，隨後又贏得了美國鑄幣局的合約。 Sorenson最後回歸，給了Inductotherm第二次機會。為了建造這套大型系統，Rowan需要資金，但銀行拒絕了他的貸款要求。他賒購了零件，並以個人擔保償還債務。 Sorenson的安裝專案在技術和財務上都取得了成功，為Inductotherm贏得了信譽。儘管銷售額不斷增長，Rowan的進取心和Foley的謹慎之間的衝突也日益加劇。',
    8:'Inductotherm公司在Foley的店裡原先的小角落已經不夠用了。 Betty在新澤西州的Delanco找到了新的廠房。隨著公司擴張，Rowan的雄心壯志與Foley對穩定的追求之間的分歧變得難以彌合。 1956年，Foley提出出售他的股份。儘管對於這家年輕的公司來說，要價很高，但Rowan還是同意了槓桿收購，成為公司的唯一所有者。他開始組建一支忠誠的團隊，並聘請了像Dick Walker這樣的前Ajax同事。公司文化逐漸形成，以勤奮、節儉和快速回應客戶需求為核心。 Rowan感受到獨自承擔全部責任的重擔，但也為這種自由而感到興奮。',
    9:'羅文公司秉持危機驅動發展的理念，營造了一種緊迫感十足的企業文化。當一場火災導致客戶（Specialloy）的工廠癱瘓時，Inductotherm公司僅用了四天時間就搭建起了一個複雜的控制面板，從而鞏固了其卓越服務的聲譽。包括採購部的湯姆·皮皮特和銷售部的羅伊·魯布爾在內的關鍵人員也加入了團隊。魯布爾對羅文的定價策略提出了質疑，認為公司應該按價值而非成本收費。為了增強員工對公司成功的歸屬感，羅文公司設立了利潤分享信託。這項創新的福利措施增強了員工的歸屬感，與競爭對手「管理階層對員工」的思維模式形成了鮮明對比。',
    10:'克魯西布爾鋼鐵公司（Crucible Steel）的一次熔爐爆炸帶來了一個絕佳的機會。羅文立即駕駛他新購買的Ercoupe飛機飛往現場，搶在競爭對手之前抵達。他提出了一個突破性的工程解決方案：以柔性導線取代複雜的同軸送料裝置，並提升熔爐產能。他承諾兩週內交付，從而成功拿下訂單。這項「緊急」任務的成功使Inductotherm公司確立了其在真空熔煉領域的領先地位。羅文意識到航空運輸的競爭優勢，於是升級到速度更快的貝蘭卡飛機。他利用這架飛機促成交易，例如與康寧玻璃公司的合作，證明了機動性和速度對於Inductotherm公司的策略至關重要',
    11:'公司遭遇重創，銷售經理傑瑞·沃拉斯頓在一場車禍中身受重傷。同時，兒子們日益惡化的健康狀況也讓羅文承受著巨大的精神壓力。他試圖將悲痛埋藏在工作中，事無鉅細地管理著蓬勃發展的業務，直到他瀕臨崩潰。在辦公桌前幾乎崩潰之際，他聽從了貝蒂的建議，召集了公司幾位關鍵經理——魯布爾、沃克、肯尼迪和卡特里奇——開會。他坦言自己已無力獨自承擔所有重擔。團隊成員挺身而出，承擔了更多責任。這種被迫的授權標誌著公司走向成熟，並使其得以擴大規模。', 
    12:'隨著團隊承擔更多責任，Inductotherm 開始專注於提升銷售專業水平，並安排員工參加戴爾卡內基培訓課程。為了與業界巨頭 Ajax 區分開來，Roy Ruble 提出了一項大膽的策略：將價格提高到比競爭對手高出 10%，以彰顯其卓越的品質和技術。出乎意料的是，這一策略奏效了，Inductotherm 的市佔率顯著提升。 Ajax 隨即發動了一場殘酷的價格戰，在每次報價中都公開壓低價格，與 Inductotherm 展開競爭。 Rowan 沒有退縮，而是奮起反擊，透過跟進降價來保住市場份額，同時依靠 Inductotherm 較低的營運成本來維持生存。這場消耗戰雖然損害了 Inductotherm 的利潤，卻重創了臃腫的 Ajax，最終導致 Ajax 被出售。',
    13:'Ajax Electrothermic 被 Magnethermic 收購。新老闆 John Logan 邀請 Rowan 共進晚餐，並大膽地提出讓他負責 Ajax 部門，建議他乾脆「放手 Inductotherm」。 Rowan 拒絕了，覺得 Logan 低估了自己的公司，覺得好笑。然而，真正的威脅出現了：Ajax 推出了“Multiductor”，一種靜態倍頻器（180 赫茲），無需電機發電機。客戶開始選擇這項新技術，而不是 Inductotherm 的馬達發電機系統。 Rowan 意識到，為了生存，Inductotherm 必須立即開發自己的靜態倍頻器，儘管他們在這方面沒有任何經驗。為了彌補這一差距，他們推出了爐子租賃計劃。',
    14:'Ajax 和 Magnethermic 的合併導致關鍵人才流失，反而使 Inductotherm 受益。羅文曾在 Ajax 時期非常欣賞的工程天才泰德·肯尼迪被洛根解僱，最終加入 Inductotherm，帶來了豐富的理論知識。此外，通道熔爐專家吉姆·霍夫和阿爾·科利拒絕搬遷到俄亥俄州。羅文資助他們成立了子公司 Inductotherm Linemelt，專門生產大型通道熔爐。此舉豐富了 Inductotherm 的產品線。霍夫立即挑戰產業極限，製造出功率遠超過理論極限的設備。這些人才的湧入使公司能夠應對 Multiductor 帶來的技術挑戰。',
    15:'為了與Multiductor競爭，羅文公司聘請了自稱掌握相關技術的拉里·海耶斯。羅文公司以六週為限，為Seaway Nickel公司建造一套500千瓦的「三線」系統。結果發現海耶斯是個騙子，他的設計圖是偷來的。羅文和泰德·肯尼迪只好利用基礎物理知識，從零開始緊急設計這套系統。他們按時完成了任務，三線系統也成功運作。然而，Ajax公司威脅要就電路中使用的「扼流圈」提起專利訴訟。 Inductotherm公司沒有屈服或支付專利費，而是設計了一種更優越的環形磁芯，繞過了專利限制，從而鞏固了其在180赫茲熔煉領域的領先地位。',
    16:'到1960年，Inductotherm公司位於德蘭科的工廠已經無法滿足其發展需求。羅文在蘭科卡斯購買了一座90英畝的農場，建造了一座配備簡易機場的現代化工廠。擴張給公司財務帶來了壓力。突然，銀行要求立即償還一筆50萬美元的貸款，理由是短期租賃資金有技術性問題。面對現金危機，羅文和魯布爾想辦法將租賃客戶轉化為購買者，讓他們擁有所購買熔爐的所有權。他們以創紀錄的速度籌集資金償還了銀行貸款。這次經驗加深了羅文對銀行的不信任，也強化了他追求財務獨立的理念。遷往蘭科卡斯為公司的快速發展奠定了基礎。',
    17:'羅文認識了J·伍丁，一位才華橫溢卻性格古怪的英國工程師，他曾被阿勒格尼·盧德倫公司解僱。兩人成立了一家合資企業Consarc，進軍真空電弧熔煉市場，這項技術對航空航天合金至關重要。羅文犯了一個致命的錯誤，他給了伍丁50%的股份。儘管Consarc在技術上取得了成功，但伍丁的行為卻變得越來越古怪和鋪張。他要求各種特權，與財務主管鮑勃·霍奇金發生衝突，並因其傲慢而疏遠了客戶。伍丁的消費與管理風格與Inductotherm公司節儉的企業文化格格不入。合作關係最終演變成一場權力鬥爭，這讓羅文深刻地認識到共享控制權以及商業夥伴品格的重要性。',
    18:'1960年代，Inductotherm公司發展迅猛，到1967年銷售額就達到了1,500萬美元。航空業成為公司文化的核心，銷售和服務人員搭乘公司飛機快速拜訪客戶。羅文聘請了專業秘書朱莉婭·格林哈爾格，她終於讓羅文混亂的辦公室恢復了秩序。公司的發展吸引了工會組織的注意。面對選舉，羅文沒有採取威脅手段，而是著重宣傳公司獨特的企業文化和利潤分享信託的價值。員工以壓倒性優勢（2.4比1）投票反對成立工會，他們珍惜與管理階層的直接聯繫。這場勝利進一步鞏固了「Inductotherm大家庭」的精神。',
    19:'環保法規終結了焦炭爐的時代，迫使鑄鐵廠轉向感應熔煉。瑞士巨頭布朗博維裡公司憑藉其大型60赫茲感應熔爐主導這一市場。英特克特姆公司苦苦掙扎，難以與之競爭，直到泰德·肯尼迪發明了「單線圈」（Unicoil），利用環形電抗器實現了無功率控制。這項創新幫助他們奪取了鋼鐵市場。後來，美國鑄幣局的新項目由顧問設計，他們傾向於布朗博維裡的方案。英特克特姆公司得標，卻被迫按照這個有缺陷的設計來建造。正如羅文所預料的那樣，當熔爐出現故障時，他用自己的設計重建了熔爐，向政府證明了英特克特姆公司的技術優勢。',
    20:'隨著現金儲備的成長，羅文開始對Inductotherm Industries進行多元化經營。他的策略是收購小型新創公司，並用資金推動其發展，而不是像傳統企業集團那樣管理。他收購了Pemberton Fabricators（鋼鐵公司）、Valley Metals（供應公司）以及其他一些公司，這些收購都源自於原所有者加入集團的意願。他也收購了Cragmet（真空熔煉公司），並獲得了相當有個性的吉米·梅特卡夫。此外，他還收購了IPE（感應加熱公司），該公司後來更名為Inductoheat。他的目標是保持每個子公司的創業精神。羅文意識到，專業化比集中化更有效。這段時期標誌著公司從單一的熔爐公司轉型為多元化的工業集團。',
    21:'固態電子裝置（可控矽整流器，SCR）開始取代馬達發電機。由於缺乏內部技術，Inductotherm 與 Pillar 合作開發了「VIP」逆變器。這款逆變器取得了巨大的成功，使馬達發電機組徹底過時。然而，Pillar 背棄了獨家協議，將產品出售給了競爭對手。 Rowan 與 Pillar 決裂，並指派 Byron Taylor（來自其子公司 IPE）開發自主逆變器。 Taylor 成功研發了 Mark II，隨後又推出了 Power-Trak，這款逆變器具有更高的效率和「無熔絲」可靠性。此舉鞏固了 Inductotherm 在固態時代的獨立性和領先地位，將 Pillar 和其他公司遠遠甩在身後。這項技術變革進一步強化了 Inductotherm 的市場主導地位。',
    22:'1968年8月，期待已久的悲劇終於降臨。羅文接到電話，得知兒子吉米病危。他立即飛往北部的喬治湖，想陪伴家人，但吉米在他抵達之前就去世了，年僅21歲。羅文悲痛欲絕。他回憶起兒子的勇氣，以及疾病如何扼殺了他的生命。這場悲劇更深了羅文的習慣，他習慣用工作來麻痺自己，更努力地推動公司發展，試圖以此逃避失去親人的痛苦。這也令人痛心地提醒我們，事業的成功並不能治癒個人的傷痛。',
    23:'Inductotherm積極拓展國際市場。傑斯·卡特里奇被派往澳洲從零開始創建子公司。他憑藉著卓越的服務和在地化生產，迅速佔據了當地市場。公司隨後將業務拓展至墨西哥和巴西。巴西分公司最初因一位不稱職的合夥人揮霍預付款而陷入困境，但漢克·勞弗被派去扭轉局面。勞弗將Inductotherm勤奮和誠信的企業文化灌輸給巴西分公司，最終使其成功了。這段時期確立了Inductotherm作為真正的跨國公司的地位，該公司不僅致力於技術輸出，更致力於將其獨特的企業文化輸出到其他國家。',
    24:'由於管理不善以及管理階層與員工之間階級矛盾激化，英國子公司Metalectric虧損嚴重。羅文解雇了行為不端的總經理，並將傑斯·卡特里奇從澳洲派往英國。傑斯打破了階級壁壘，他親自下班，與工人們一起在當地酒吧喝酒。他將公司更名為Inductotherm Europe，灌輸了一種團隊合作精神。公司實現了驚人的轉變。公司獲利能力大幅提升，並獲得了著名的女王工業獎。傑斯的成功證明了Inductotherm的理念可以超越文化界限。',
    25:'羅文擔心成功會滋生自滿情緒。與Pillar公司（該公司開始直接向競爭對手銷售產品）的危機帶來了必要的衝擊。 Inductotherm公司被迫立即開發自己的固態技術。此前，IPE子公司的拜倫·泰勒曾以極低的預算開發出名為「Shazaam」的逆變器，以保住自己的飯碗。羅文將泰勒帶到蘭科卡斯，讓他設計一款熔化逆變器。由此誕生的Mark II以及後來的Power-Trak系列產品實現了技術上的飛躍，效率提升至95%。這場危機使公司重獲新生，證明他們仍然能夠快速反應並進行創新。與Pillar公司的決裂最終使Inductotherm公司更加強大。',
    26:'J·伍丁在康薩克公司的情況變得難以忍受。伍丁的自負、揮霍和好訴訟的性格威脅著公司的存亡。他疏遠客戶，起訴臆想中的敵人，並虐待員工。羅文最終設法獲得了55%的控股權，使這家子公司免於破產。在一次有牧師和律師在場的戲劇性董事會會議上，伍丁被罷免。伍丁提起訴訟，引發了一場曠日持久的法律戰，但法院最終維持了收購方案。伍丁離開後，史丹·邁爾斯接管了公司，使康薩克恢復了穩定和盈利。這次「驅魔」消除了有害影響，使這家子公司再次蓬勃發展。',
    27:'羅文向他多年的得力助手、Inductotherm公司總裁羅伊·魯布爾致敬。魯布爾嚴謹的管理、正直的品格和定價策略對公司的發展至關重要。他是一位談判大師，也是銷售團隊的良師益友。不幸的是，魯布爾於1984年因癌症去世。為了接替他，魯布爾培養了約翰·莫蒂默，這位前Inductotherm澳洲公司負責人。莫蒂默帶來了一種截然不同、更平易近人的管理風格——在車間安裝空調，並消除管理層和員工之間的隔閡。在銷售主管保羅·塞維萊羅的支持下，莫蒂默繼續推動公司發展。羅文退居幕後，負責控股公司的運營，並對新的領導團隊充滿信心。',
    28:'Inductotherm Industries加快了收購策略，先後收購了Magnetic Metals、Vantage Products和Lepel等多家公司。 Rowan運用一套透明的財務圖表系統來監控各項關鍵指標，進而管理這個龐大的商業帝國。雖然大多數收購都取得了成功，但也有一些需要介入。 SMS的Jerry Ciccone因挪用公款被解僱，後來銼鐺入獄。在IPE（後來更名為Inductoheat），Byron Taylor接替了未能獲利的Bill Peschel。 Taylor精簡了官僚機構，打造了以成果為導向的企業文化，並利用公司專機來促進銷售。在Taylor的領導下，Inductoheat發展成為全球領先的企業。控股公司發展成為一家多元化企業集團，但仍保持對企業自主經營的重視。',
    29:'傑斯·卡特里奇接受了他最後也是最艱鉅的任務：建立日本Inductotherm公司。面對巨額成本（每月4000美元的房租）和封閉的商業文化，傑斯堅持不懈。他學習日語，並穿上工作服培訓員工，打破了文化習俗。三菱和新光電機等國內競爭對手為了將他擠出市場而大幅降價。然而，Inductotherm憑藉其卓越的技術（Power-Trak）和優質的服務最終贏得了市場。三菱最後退出了爐窯業務，Inductotherm日本公司一躍成為產業巨頭。這場在亞洲製造業「獅穴」中的勝利，標誌著Inductotherm在全球範圍內的統治地位的最終確立。',
    30:'1978年12月，悲劇再次降臨。羅文的次子大衛因肌肉萎縮症去世，享年28歲。儘管身體殘疾，只能依靠輪椅行動，大衛卻擁有豐富多彩的人生，他熱愛繪畫、製作電子產品，並透過CB無線電與外界交流。他的離世對這個家庭來說是毀滅性的打擊。在吉米去世十年後，大衛的離世標誌著他們與這種疾病漫長而痛苦的鬥爭終於結束。這件事也讓羅文更加深刻地體會到，事業上的成功固然令人欣喜，但它無法抵禦最深切的個人創傷。',
    31:'羅文看中了印度的巨大潛力。早期的直銷模式飽受官僚主義和腐敗的困擾，而Inductotherm公司拒絕捲入其中。一位名叫庫馬爾·哈維的前代理商背叛了他們，投奔了競爭對手。最終，羅文遇到了基肖爾·維亞斯，一位印度工程師，他曾抄襲Inductotherm的設計並創建了自己的公司。維亞斯的正直和堅韌給羅文留下了深刻的印象，於是他與維亞斯成立了合資企業——Inductotherm印度公司。儘管面臨政府的限制，這家合資企業憑藉其高標準的道德規範和引進的現代技術取得了成功。該公司幫助印度鑄造業實現了現代化，生產出不銹鋼餐具等基本生活用品，造福大眾。',
    32:'羅文反思了全球擴張的風險和複雜性。英特克特姆公司在沒有總體規劃的情況下，憑藉著果斷的行動，一躍成為全球最大的爐具製造商。然而，成功也帶來了新的危險，尤其是政治危險。本章是涉及康薩克公司的重大地緣政治衝突的序幕。它詳細描述了由吉米·梅特卡夫領導的康薩克公司如何向蘇聯出售真空爐。儘管最初獲得了批准，但當情報機構懷疑這些爐子被用於製造導彈的「碳碳」彈頭時，這筆交易變得充滿爭議。羅文最終命令梅特卡夫停止該項目，導致梅特卡夫辭職。',
    33:'康薩克公司獲得了一份向伊拉克出售用於醫療義肢的電子束爐的合約。美國商務部批准了這筆交易。然而，隨著海灣戰爭前夕地緣政治局勢的變化，白宮擔心這些設備被用於核武器，阻止了這批貨物的交付。媒體將康薩克公司貼上了「科技強盜」的標籤。羅文對政府的反覆無常和媒體的歪曲報道感到憤怒。他起訴伊拉克政府違約，並贏得了巨額賠償（儘管這筆錢無法執行）。這起事件凸顯了高科技出口的風險，也讓羅文對政府處理合法商業交易的方式感到憤慨，儘管康薩克公司最終還是保留了預付款。',
    34:'1990年，籌款人菲爾·圖米尼亞（Phil Tumminia）找到羅文大學，希望它能為格拉斯伯勒州立學院（Glassboro State College）捐款。羅文大學最初象徵性地捐贈了1500美元，但隨後與圖米尼亞建立了友誼。圖米尼亞請求羅文大學捐贈建造一座圖書館，但羅文大學拒絕了，因為它只對工程教育感興趣。最終，圖米尼亞假設學院有1億美元會做什麼。羅文大學正尋求新的挑戰，也想回饋新澤西州，於是決定向學院捐贈1億美元——這是有史以​​來對公立機構的最大捐款。唯一的條件是建立一所一流的工程學院。學院同意更名為羅文學院（Rowan College）。',
    35:'一億美元捐贈的消息一公佈，引發媒體狂潮。爭議隨之爆發：校友們就更名一事提起訴訟，工會則抨擊獎學金條款，該條款規定除非經過協商，否則集體談判單位無法參與。媒體將羅文描繪成一個自私自利、打壓工會的惡棍。羅文召開記者會，澄清他捐贈的初衷——改善教育，且無任何附加條件。這股熱潮逐漸平息。羅文開始轉移捐款。在尾聲中，他回顧了自己的一生，痛失愛子，女兒金妮和公司的成就，以及他始終渴望迎接挑戰的決心。他心中的「火焰」依然熊熊燃燒。',
