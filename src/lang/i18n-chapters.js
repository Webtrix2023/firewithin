    0: `In 1955, Henry Rowan faces a critical crisis at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. His young company, Inductotherm, has installed six new furnaces, but the maintenance crew complains that changing the power cables takes too long. To save the contract and his reputation, Rowan accepts a dangerous wager: he bets he can change the cables on a fully hot furnace in under ten minutes. This scene illustrates Rowan’s engineering prowess and willingness to take risks. He succeeds, proving his design is superior to the industry standard, and secures the Mint's acceptance, marking a turning point for his fledging company.`,
    1: `Rowan recounts his early life, shaped by the abrupt departure of his father when Henry was six. Raised by a strong-willed mother who lost her family fortune in the 1929 crash, Rowan learns the values of frugality and self-reliance. He displays early entrepreneurial spirit by raising chickens. He attends MIT, then joins the Army Air Corps after Pearl Harbor, becoming a bomber pilot. The chapter covers his marriage to Betty and his eventual reconnection with his estranged father. This reconciliation provides closure, allowing Rowan to move forward with a drive to prove his worth to the world.`,
    2: `After World War II, Rowan returns to MIT with his wife, Betty. They live on a meager budget of $135 a month, raising two children in cramped student housing. Rowan embraces the grueling academic workload, learning to solve complex engineering problems that go beyond textbook theory. He develops a deep appreciation for the economics of engineering. Despite graduating with high honors in 1947, he is rejected by Phi Beta Kappa for not being "well-rounded." He joins Ajax Electrothermic, drawn to the company’s potential in induction melting and its location near his father’s home.`,
    3: `At Ajax, Rowan initially dislikes sales but thrives in field service, troubleshooting furnace problems. He realizes that Ajax, though an industry pioneer, has become complacent and is losing ground to competitors. Rowan proposes innovations, such as using capacitors instead of expensive synchronous motors, but shortsighted management rejects his ideas. Frustrated by corporate inertia, he channels his energy into building his own concrete home by hand. During this project, he hires a local teenager, Jess Cartlidge, beginning a lifelong professional relationship. Rowan’s dissatisfaction with Ajax grows as he sees clear opportunities for technological advancement being ignored.`,
    4: `This brief, emotionally charged chapter details a personal tragedy. While reading a Reader's Digest article about Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Rowan recognizes the symptoms described in the text in his own young son, Jimmy. Medical consultations confirm the devastating diagnosis: a progressive, fatal muscle-wasting disease with no known cure. The tragedy is compounded when his third child, David, is born and subsequently diagnosed with the same affliction. Faced with the reality that his sons will suffer progressive paralysis and early death, Rowan and Betty resolve to endure and make their children's shortened lives as fulfilling as possible.`,
    5: `Work becomes Rowan’s escape from the grief of his sons’ illness. At Ajax, he is finally transferred to the engineering department but clashes with the new president, Dean Meyer, over innovation and efficiency. Rowan hopes for the Assistant Chief Engineer position, feeling he has earned it through dedication and skill. However, Ajax hires an outsider for the role. Feeling his path to advancement is blocked and his contributions are undervalued, Rowan resigns on principle. Despite having a family to support and no immediate job lined up, he leaves Ajax in 1953, supported by Betty’s unwavering confidence.`,
    6: `After a brief stint turning around a marine hardware factory, Rowan receives a call from Paul Foley, a former customer. Foley proposes they start an induction business. In 1953, Inductotherm is incorporated. Working evenings in his garage, Rowan builds the company's first 60-pound furnace for Foley. The furnace is a success. By 1954, Rowan commits to Inductotherm full-time, selling his house to capitalize the company. Operating out of a dusty corner of Foley’s shop with a $10 filing cabinet and second-hand tools, Rowan rehires Jess Cartlidge. Together, they face the daunting task of competing against the established giant, Ajax.`,
    7: `Inductotherm struggles to survive in its infancy. They lose a critical bid for Sorenson Industries to Ajax, leading partner Paul Foley to suggest closing the business. Rowan refuses to quit. A breakthrough comes with a small order from General Electric, followed by the U.S. Mint contract. Sorenson eventually returns, offering Inductotherm another chance. To build this large system, Rowan needs capital, but banks refuse him. He secures components on credit, personally guaranteeing the debt. The Sorenson installation is a technical and financial success, establishing Inductotherm’s credibility. Despite growing sales, tensions rise between Rowan’s drive and Foley’s caution.`,
    8: `Inductotherm outgrows its corner in Foley’s shop. Betty locates a new facility in Delanco, New Jersey. As the company expands, the divergence between Rowan’s aggressive ambition and Foley’s desire for stability becomes untenable. In 1956, Foley offers to sell his share. Although the asking price is steep for the young company, Rowan agrees to a leveraged buyout, becoming the sole owner. He begins assembling a loyal team, hiring former Ajax colleagues like Dick Walker. The company culture solidifies around hard work, frugality, and rapid response to customer needs. Rowan feels the weight of sole responsibility but is exhilarated by the freedom.`,
    9: `Rowan cultivates a corporate culture of urgency, believing that crisis drives progress. When a fire disables a customer’s plant (Specialloy), Inductotherm builds a complex control panel in just four days, cementing a reputation for unmatched service. Key personnel join the team, including Tom Pippitt in purchasing and Roy Ruble in sales. Ruble challenges Rowan on pricing, arguing they should charge for value, not just cost. To bond the growing workforce to the company’s success, Rowan establishes a Profit Sharing Trust. This innovative benefit creates a sense of ownership among employees, contrasting sharply with the "management vs. labor" mentality of competitors.`,
    10: `A furnace explosion at Crucible Steel provides a major opportunity. Rowan flies his newly acquired Ercoupe to the site immediately, beating competitors. He proposes a radical engineering solution: replacing a complex coaxial feed with flexible leads and upgrading the furnace capacity. He secures the order by promising a two-week delivery. The success of this "emergency" job positions Inductotherm as a leader in vacuum melting. Recognizing the competitive advantage of aviation, Rowan upgrades to a faster Bellanca aircraft. He uses the plane to close deals, such as one with Corning Glass, proving that mobility and speed are essential to Inductotherm’s strategy.`,
    11: `Tragedy strikes the company when sales manager Jerry Wollaston is critically injured in a car crash. Simultaneously, the emotional toll of his sons’ deteriorating health weighs heavily on Rowan. He attempts to bury his grief in work, micromanaging every aspect of the booming business until he reaches a breaking point. Suffering a near-breakdown at his desk, he heeds Betty’s advice and calls his key managers—Ruble, Walker, Kennedy, and Cartlidge—together. He admits he can no longer carry the load alone. The team steps up, taking on greater responsibility. This forced delegation marks a maturation point for the company, allowing it to scale up.`,
    12: `With the team taking more responsibility, Inductotherm focuses on sales professionalism, enrolling staff in Dale Carnegie courses. To differentiate from the giant Ajax, Roy Ruble proposes a bold strategy: raising prices 10% above the competition to signal superior quality and technology. Surprisingly, the strategy works, increasing market share. Ajax retaliates with a vicious price war, openly undercutting Inductotherm on every bid. Instead of retreating, Rowan fights back, matching cuts to hold market share while relying on Inductotherm’s lower operating costs to survive. The war of attrition hurts Inductotherm’s profits but devastates the bloated Ajax, eventually leading to Ajax’s sale.`,
    13: `Ajax Electrothermic is acquired by Magnethermic. John Logan, the new owner, invites Rowan to dinner and audaciously offers him a job running the Ajax division, suggesting he simply "let Inductotherm go." Rowan refuses, amused by Logan’s underestimation of his company. However, a real threat emerges: Ajax introduces the "Multiductor," a static frequency multiplier (180 cycles) that eliminates the need for motor-generators. Customers begin choosing this new technology over Inductotherm’s motor-generator systems. Rowan realizes that to survive, Inductotherm must develop its own static frequency multiplier immediately, despite having no experience with the technology. To bridge the gap, they introduce a furnace rental program.`,
    14: `The consolidation of Ajax and Magnethermic alienates key talent, benefiting Inductotherm. Ted Kennedy, the engineering genius Rowan once admired at Ajax, is fired by Logan and eventually joins Inductotherm, bringing immense theoretical knowledge. Additionally, Jim Hoff and Al Coley, experts in channel furnaces, refuse to relocate to Ohio. Rowan finances them to start a subsidiary, Inductotherm Linemelt, to build large channel furnaces. This move diversifies Inductotherm’s product line. Hoff immediately challenges industry limitations, building higher-powered units than theoretically thought possible. This influx of talent positions the company to tackle the technical challenges posed by the Multiductor.`,
    15: `Desperate to compete with the Multiductor, Rowan hires Larry Hayes, who claims to know the technology. Rowan bets the company on a six-week deadline to build a 500kW "Tri-Line" system for Seaway Nickel. Hayes turns out to be a fraud with stolen plans. Rowan and Ted Kennedy frantically engineer the system from scratch using basic physics. They meet the deadline, and the Tri-Line works. However, Ajax threatens a patent lawsuit over the "chokes" used in the circuit. Rather than yield or pay royalties, Inductotherm engineers a superior toroidal core design that bypasses the patent, securing their leadership in 180-cycle melting.`,
    16: `By 1960, Inductotherm has outgrown its Delanco plant. Rowan purchases a 90-acre farm in Rancocas to build a modern facility complete with an airstrip. The expansion strains finances. Suddenly, the bank calls a $500,000 loan, demanding immediate repayment due to a technicality regarding short-term funds used for leasing. Facing a cash crisis, Rowan and Ruble rally by converting lease customers into buyers, offering them ownership of their furnaces. They raise the cash to pay off the bank in record time. The experience solidifies Rowan’s distrust of banks and reinforces his philosophy of financial independence. The move to Rancocas sets the stage for massive growth.`,
    17: `Rowan meets J Wooding, a brilliant but eccentric British engineer fired from Allegheny Ludlum. They form a joint venture, Consarc, to enter the vacuum-arc melting market, essential for aerospace alloys. Rowan makes a critical error by granting Wooding 50% ownership. While Consarc becomes technically successful, Wooding’s behavior becomes increasingly erratic and extravagant. He demands perks, clashes with treasurer Bob Hotchkin, and alienates customers with his arrogance. Wooding’s spending and management style clash violently with Inductotherm’s culture of frugality. The partnership deteriorates into a power struggle, teaching Rowan a hard lesson about shared control and the importance of character in business partners.`,
    18: `Inductotherm grows rapidly in the 1960s, with sales reaching $15 million by 1967. Aviation becomes central to the business culture, with sales and service staff flying company planes to reach customers quickly. Rowan hires Julia Greenhalgh, a professional secretary who finally brings order to his chaotic office. The growing company attracts union organizers. Facing an election, Rowan fights back not with threats, but by communicating the value of the company’s unique culture and the Profit Sharing Trust. The employees vote overwhelmingly against the union (2.4 to 1), valuing their direct relationship with management. This victory reinforces the "Inductotherm family" spirit.`,
    19: `Environmental regulations doom the coke-fired cupola, forcing iron foundries to switch to induction melting. Swiss giant Brown Boveri dominates this market with large 60-cycle furnaces. Inductotherm struggles to compete until Ted Kennedy invents the "Unicoil," allowing for stepless power control using toroidal reactors. This innovation helps them capture the iron market. Later, the new U.S. Mint project is designed by consultants favoring Brown Boveri’s specs. Inductotherm wins the bid but is forced to build to the flawed design. When the furnaces fail as Rowan predicted, he rebuilds them with his own design, proving Inductotherm’s technical superiority to the government.`,
    20: `With cash reserves growing, Rowan diversifies Inductotherm Industries. His strategy is to acquire small, entrepreneurial companies and fuel their growth with capital, rather than managing them as a traditional conglomerate. He acquires Pemberton Fabricators (steel), Valley Metals (supply), and others based on the owners' desire to join the group. He buys Cragmet (vacuum melting) and acquires the colorful Jimmy Metcalf. He also buys IPE (induction heating), later known as Inductoheat. The goal is to keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive in each subsidiary. Rowan realizes that specialization works better than centralization. This period marks the transition from a single furnace company to a diverse industrial group.`,
    21: `Solid-state electronics (SCRs) begin to replace motor-generators. Lacking in-house expertise, Inductotherm partners with Pillar to build the "VIP" inverter. It’s a massive success, rendering M-G sets obsolete. However, Pillar betrays the exclusive agreement, selling to competitors. Rowan breaks with Pillar and tasks Byron Taylor (from subsidiary IPE) to develop an in-house inverter. Taylor succeeds with the Mark II and later the "Power-Trak," which offers superior efficiency and "fuseless" reliability. This move secures Inductotherm’s independence and leadership in the solid-state era, leaving Pillar and others behind. This technological shift cements Inductotherm's dominance.`,
    22: `In August 1968, the long-anticipated tragedy strikes. Rowan receives a call that his son Jimmy is dying. He flies north to Lake George to be with his family, but Jimmy passes away at age twenty-one before he arrives. The grief is profound. Rowan reflects on his son’s courage and the potential cut short by the disease. The loss reinforces Rowan’s tendency to immerse himself in work as a coping mechanism, driving the company even harder as a way to outrun the pain of his personal loss. It is a somber reminder that business success cannot cure personal heartbreak.`,
    23: `Inductotherm pushes aggressively into international markets. Jess Cartlidge is sent to Australia to start a subsidiary from scratch. He dominates the local market by offering superior service and manufacturing locally. The company also expands into Mexico and Brazil. The Brazilian venture initially falters due to a poor partner who spent advances on frivolities, but Hank Raufer is sent in to turn it around. Raufer instills Inductotherm’s culture of hard work and integrity, making the Brazilian subsidiary a success. This era establishes Inductotherm as a true multinational entity, willing to export its unique corporate culture along with its technology.`,
    24: `The British subsidiary, Metalectric, is hemorrhaging money due to poor management and class-based friction between management and labor. Rowan fires the managing director for unethical behavior and sends Jess Cartlidge from Australia to the UK. Jess dismantles the class barriers, rolling up his sleeves in the shop and drinking with workers at the local pub. He renames the company Inductotherm Europe and instills a spirit of teamwork. The turnaround is spectacular. The company becomes highly profitable and receives the prestigious Queen’s Award to Industry. Jess’s success proves that the Inductotherm philosophy can transcend cultural boundaries.`,
    25: `Rowan worries that success is breeding complacency. The crisis with Pillar (who began selling directly to competitors) provides the necessary shock. Inductotherm is forced to develop its own solid-state technology immediately. Byron Taylor, at the IPE subsidiary, had previously developed a "Shazaam" inverter on a shoestring budget to save his own job. Rowan brings Taylor to Rancocas to design a melting inverter. The resulting Mark II and later Power-Trak units are technological leaps forward, improving efficiency to 95%. The crisis revitalizes the company, proving they can still react with speed and innovation. The break with Pillar ultimately makes Inductotherm stronger.`,
    26: `The situation with J Wooding at Consarc becomes intolerable. Wooding’s ego, extravagance, and litigious nature threaten to destroy the company. He alienates customers, sues imaginary enemies, and abuses staff. Rowan finally maneuvers to take majority control (55%) to save the subsidiary from bankruptcy. In a dramatic board meeting involving priests and lawyers, Wooding is ousted. Wooding sues, leading to a drawn-out legal battle, but the court ultimately upholds the buyout formula. With Wooding gone, Stan Myers takes over, restoring stability and profitability to Consarc. The "exorcism" removes a toxic influence, allowing the subsidiary to flourish again.`,
    27: `Rowan pays tribute to Roy Ruble, his long-time right-hand man and President of Inductotherm Corp. Ruble’s disciplined management, integrity, and pricing strategies were pivotal to the company’s growth. He was a master negotiator and mentor to the sales team. Tragically, Ruble dies of cancer in 1984. To succeed him, Ruble had groomed John Mortimer, the former head of Inductotherm Australia. Mortimer brings a different, more accessible management style—installing air conditioning in the shop and removing barriers between management and staff. Supported by Paul Cervellero in sales, Mortimer continues the company’s growth. Rowan steps back to run the holding company, trusting the new leadership.`,
    28: `Inductotherm Industries accelerates its acquisition strategy, buying diverse companies like Magnetic Metals, Vantage Products, and Lepel. Rowan manages this empire using a system of transparent financial charts to monitor vital signs. While most acquisitions prosper, some require intervention. Jerry Ciccone of SMS is fired for embezzlement and later jailed. At IPE (later Inductoheat), Byron Taylor replaces Bill Peschel, who could not make a profit. Taylor cuts bureaucracy, creates a results-oriented culture, and utilizes corporate aircraft to boost sales. Under Taylor, Inductoheat becomes a world leader. The holding company grows into a conglomerate, but retains its focus on entrepreneurial autonomy.`,
    29: `Jess Cartlidge takes on his final and toughest assignment: establishing Inductotherm Japan. Facing immense costs ($4,000/month rent for a house) and a closed business culture, Jess perseveres. He learns Japanese and dons work clothes to train his staff, breaking cultural norms. Domestic competitors like Mitsubishi and Shinko Denki slash prices to drive him out. However, Inductotherm’s superior technology (Power-Trak) and service eventually win over the market. Mitsubishi eventually exits the furnace business, and Inductotherm Japan becomes a major player. This victory in the "lion’s den" of Asian manufacturing completes Inductotherm’s global dominance.`,
    30: `In December 1978, tragedy strikes again. Rowan’s second son, David, passes away at age 28 from muscular dystrophy. Despite his physical confinement to a wheelchair, David had lived an intellectually rich life, painting, building electronics, and engaging the world via CB radio. The loss is devastating to the family. Coming a decade after Jimmy’s death, it marks the end of a long, painful struggle against the disease. The event underscores for Rowan that while business success is rewarding, it cannot protect against the deepest personal losses.`,
    31: `Rowan eyes the vast potential of India. Early direct sales are plagued by bureaucracy and corruption, which Inductotherm refuses to engage in. A former agent, Kumar Harve, betrays them for a competitor. Finally, Rowan meets Kishore Vyas, an Indian engineer who had copied Inductotherm’s designs to build his own company. Impressed by Vyas’s integrity and tenacity, Rowan forms a joint venture, Inductotherm India. Despite government restrictions, the venture succeeds by maintaining high ethical standards and introducing modern technology. The company helps modernize India’s foundry industry, producing basic goods like stainless steel flatware for the population.`,
    32: `Rowan reflects on the risks and complexities of global expansion. Without a master plan, Inductotherm became the world's largest furnace manufacturer by acting decisively. However, success brings new dangers, specifically political ones. This chapter serves as a prelude to the major geopolitical conflicts involving Consarc. It details how Consarc, led by Jimmy Metcalf, sold vacuum furnaces to the Soviet Union. While initially approved, the deal became controversial when intelligence agencies suspected the furnaces were for making "carbon-carbon" nose cones for missiles. Rowan eventually ordered Metcalf to stop work on the project, leading to Metcalf's resignation.`,
    33: `Consarc secures a contract to sell electron-beam furnaces to Iraq for medical prosthetics. The U.S. Commerce Department approves the sale. However, as the geopolitical climate shifts prior to the Gulf War, the White House blocks the shipment, fearing nuclear applications. The media brands Consarc as "technobandits." Rowan is furious at the government's flip-flopping and the media's distortion. He sues the Iraqi government for breach of contract and wins a massive judgment (though uncollectible). The incident highlights the perils of high-tech exports and leaves Rowan bitter about the government's handling of legitimate business deals, although Consarc eventually retains the down payment.`,
    34: `In 1990, fundraiser Phil Tumminia approaches Rowan for a donation to Glassboro State College. Rowan initially gives a token $1,500 but strikes up a friendship with Tumminia. Tumminia asks for a library donation; Rowan refuses, interested only in engineering education. Eventually, Tumminia asks hypothetically what the college would do with $100 million. Rowan, looking for a new challenge and wanting to give back to New Jersey, decides to pledge $100 million to the college—the largest gift to a public institution ever. The only condition is the establishment of a top-quality engineering school. The college agrees to rename itself Rowan College.`,
    35: `The announcement of the $100 million gift creates a media frenzy. Controversy erupts: alumni sue over the name change, and unions attack the scholarship clause which excludes collective bargaining units unless negotiated. The media paints Rowan as an egotist and union-buster. Rowan holds a press conference to clarify his simple, unconditional intent: to improve education. The fervor dies down. Rowan begins transferring the funds. In the epilogue, he reflects on his life, the loss of his sons, the success of his daughter Ginny and the company, and his continued desire for challenges. The "fire within" remains unquenched.`,

    0: `1955년, 헨리 로완은 필라델피아의 미국 조폐국(U.S. Mint)에서 중대한 위기에 직면합니다. 그의 신생 기업인 인덕토썸(Inductotherm)이 6개의 새로운 용해로를 설치했으나, 유지보수팀은 전원 케이블 교체에 시간이 너무 오래 걸린다며 불만을 제기했습니다. 계약과 회사의 명성을 지키기 위해 로완은 위험한 내기를 겁니다. 그는 뜨겁게 가열된 용해로의 케이블을 10분 안에 교체하겠다고 호언장담합니다. 이 장면은 로완의 엔지니어링 능력과 위험을 감수하는 기질을 잘 보여줍니다. 결국 그는 성공하여 자신의 설계가 업계 표준보다 우수함을 입증하고 조폐국의 신뢰를 얻어내며 회사 성장의 전환점을 마련합니다.`,
    1: `로완은 6살 때 아버지가 떠나버린 후 형성된 자신의 어린 시절을 회상합니다. 1929년 대공황으로 가문의 재산을 잃은 강인한 어머니 밑에서 자란 그는 검소함과 자립심을 배웠습니다. 그는 닭을 키우며 일찍이 사업가적 기질을 보였고, MIT에 진학한 후 진주만 공습이 터지자 육군 항공대에 입대하여 폭격기 조종사가 되었습니다. 이 챕터는 아내 베티와의 결혼, 그리고 소원해졌던 아버지와의 재회를 다룹니다. 아버지와의 화해는 그에게 심리적 안정을 주었고, 세상에 자신의 가치를 증명해 보이겠다는 열정을 품고 앞으로 나아가는 계기가 되었습니다.`,
    2: `제2차 세계대전 후, 로완은 아내 베티와 함께 MIT로 돌아옵니다. 그들은 한 달에 135달러라는 적은 예산으로 비좁은 학생 기숙사에서 두 아이를 키우며 생활합니다. 로완은 혹독한 학업을 소화하며 교과서 이론을 넘어서는 복잡한 공학 문제를 해결하는 법을 배웁니다. 그는 공학의 경제적 측면에 대해서도 깊이 이해하게 됩니다. 1947년 우수한 성적으로 졸업했음에도 불구하고 '다재다능하지 않다'는 이유로 파이 베타 카파(Phi Beta Kappa) 클럽 가입은 거절당합니다. 그는 유도 용해 분야의 잠재력과 아버지 집과의 근접성을 고려하여 에이잭스 일렉트로써믹(Ajax Electrothermic)에 입사합니다.`,
    3: `에이잭스에서 로완은 처음에는 영업 업무를 싫어했지만, 용해로 문제를 해결하는 현장 서비스 업무에서는 두각을 나타냅니다. 그는 업계 선구자였던 에이잭스가 현실에 안주하며 경쟁사들에게 밀리고 있음을 깨닫습니다. 로완은 비싼 동기 전동기 대신 커패시터를 사용하는 등의 혁신안을 제안하지만, 근시안적인 경영진은 이를 거절합니다. 회사의 타성에 좌절한 그는 자신의 콘크리트 집을 직접 짓는 데 에너지를 쏟습니다. 이 과정에서 동네 청소년인 제스 카트리지(Jess Cartlidge)를 고용하게 되는데, 이는 평생의 인연으로 이어집니다. 기술적 진보의 기회를 무시하는 에이잭스에 대한 로완의 불만은 점점 커져만 갑니다.`,
    4: `이 짧지만 감정적으로 강렬한 챕터는 로완의 개인적인 비극을 다룹니다. 로완은 리더스 다이제스트에서 뒤셴 근이영양증에 관한 기사를 읽다가 자신의 어린 아들 지미에게서 같은 증상을 발견합니다. 의사와의 상담 끝에, 치료법이 없는 치명적인 진행성 근육 소모 질환이라는 진단을 받게 됩니다. 셋째 아들 데이비드마저 같은 병을 앓고 있다는 사실이 밝혀지며 비극은 더해집니다. 아들들이 점차 마비되어 일찍 세상을 떠날 것이라는 현실 앞에서, 로완과 베티는 고통을 견뎌내며 아이들의 짧은 생을 최대한 행복하게 만들어 주기로 결심합니다.`,
    5: `일은 아들들의 병으로 인한 슬픔으로부터 로완이 도피할 수 있는 수단이었습니다. 에이잭스에서 마침내 엔지니어링 부서로 발령받았지만, 그는 혁신과 효율성 문제로 신임 사장 딘 메이어와 충돌합니다. 로완은 자신의 헌신과 능력을 바탕으로 부수석 엔지니어 자리를 원했으나, 회사는 외부 인사를 채용합니다. 승진 길이 막히고 자신의 기여가 인정받지 못한다고 느낀 로완은 신념을 지키기 위해 사직합니다. 부양해야 할 가족이 있고 정해진 직장도 없었지만, 아내 베티의 변함없는 지지 속에 1953년 그는 에이잭스를 떠납니다.`,
    6: `선박 하드웨어 공장을 회생시키는 일을 잠시 맡았던 로완은 전 고객이었던 폴 폴리(Paul Foley)로부터 연락을 받습니다. 폴리는 유도 용해로 사업을 함께 시작하자고 제안합니다. 1953년 인덕토썸이 설립되었고, 로완은 저녁마다 차고에서 작업하여 폴리를 위한 첫 60파운드 용해로를 제작합니다. 이 용해로가 성공하자 1954년 로완은 집을 팔아 자본금을 마련하고 인덕토썸에 전념하기로 합니다. 폴리의 공장 한구석에서 10달러짜리 서류 캐비닛과 중고 공구로 시작한 그는 제스 카트리지를 다시 고용하고, 거대 기업 에이잭스와의 힘겨운 경쟁을 시작합니다.`,
    7: `인덕토썸은 초창기 생존을 위해 고군분투합니다. 소렌슨 인더스트리(Sorenson Industries)의 중요한 입찰 경쟁에서 에이잭스에게 패하자, 파트너인 폴 폴리는 사업을 접자고 제안합니다. 하지만 로완은 포기를 거부합니다. 제너럴 일렉트릭(GE)의 작은 주문과 미국 조폐국 계약을 따내며 돌파구를 마련하고, 소렌슨 역시 인덕토썸에 다시 기회를 줍니다. 대형 시스템 제작을 위한 자금이 필요했으나 은행 대출이 거절되자, 로완은 개인 보증을 서며 외상으로 부품을 확보합니다. 소렌슨 프로젝트는 기술적, 재정적으로 성공하며 회사의 신뢰도를 높였지만, 로완의 공격적인 성향과 폴리의 신중함 사이의 긴장은 커져만 갑니다.`,
    8: `인덕토썸은 폴리의 공장 한구석에서 더 이상 지낼 수 없을 만큼 성장합니다. 베티가 뉴저지주 델란코에 새로운 공장을 찾아냅니다. 회사가 확장됨에 따라, 로완의 공격적인 야망과 안정을 추구하는 폴리 사이의 괴리는 좁혀지지 않습니다. 1956년, 폴리는 자신의 지분을 팔겠다고 제안합니다. 신생 기업에게는 부담스러운 가격이었지만, 로완은 차입 매수(LBO)에 동의하고 단독 소유주가 됩니다. 그는 딕 워커와 같은 전 에이잭스 동료들을 영입하여 충성스러운 팀을 꾸립니다. 근면, 검소, 그리고 고객 요구에 대한 신속한 대응이라는 기업 문화가 확립됩니다. 로완은 홀로 모든 책임을 져야 한다는 부담감을 느끼면서도 자유로움에 들뜹니다.`,
    9: `로완은 위기가 발전을 이끈다는 믿음으로 긴박감이 넘치는 기업 문화를 조성합니다. 고객사(Specialloy) 공장에 화재가 발생하자, 인덕토썸은 단 4일 만에 복잡한 제어 패널을 제작해 주며 타의 추종을 불허하는 서비스 명성을 얻습니다. 구매 담당 톰 피핏과 영업 담당 로이 루블 같은 핵심 인재들도 합류합니다. 루블은 원가가 아닌 가치에 기반한 가격 책정을 주장하며 로완에게 도전합니다. 로완은 직원들을 회사의 성공과 연결하기 위해 이익 공유 신탁(Profit Sharing Trust)을 설립합니다. 이 혁신적인 복지 제도는 직원들에게 주인의식을 심어주었으며, 이는 경쟁사들의 노사 대립적 분위기와는 대조적인 것이었습니다.`,
    10: `크루시블 스틸(Crucible Steel)의 용해로 폭발 사고는 큰 기회가 됩니다. 로완은 새로 구입한 비행기(Ercoupe)를 타고 즉시 현장으로 날아가 경쟁사보다 먼저 도착합니다. 그는 복잡한 동축 케이블 대신 유연한 리드선을 사용하고 용해로 용량을 늘리는 급진적인 기술적 해결책을 제안합니다. 그는 2주 납기를 약속하며 주문을 따냅니다. 이 '긴급' 프로젝트의 성공으로 인덕토썸은 진공 용해 분야의 리더로 자리매김합니다. 항공기가 주는 경쟁우위를 깨달은 로완은 더 빠른 벨란카(Bellanca) 기종으로 업그레이드합니다. 그는 코닝 글래스와의 계약 등에서 비행기를 활용하며, 기동성과 속도가 인덕토썸 전략의 핵심임을 입증합니다.`,
    11: `영업 매니저 제리 월라스턴이 교통사고로 치명상을 입으면서 회사에 비극이 닥칩니다. 동시에 아들들의 건강 악화로 인한 정서적 고통이 로완을 짓누릅니다. 그는 슬픔을 잊기 위해 일에 매달리며 급성장하는 사업의 모든 부분을 세세하게 관리하려다 결국 한계에 부딪힙니다. 사무실에서 거의 쓰러질 뻔한 그는 베티의 조언을 받아들여 루블, 워커, 케네디, 카트리지 등 핵심 관리자들을 소집합니다. 그는 더 이상 혼자 짐을 질 수 없음을 인정합니다. 팀원들은 기꺼이 더 큰 책임을 맡으며 나섭니다. 이러한 강제적인 권한 위임은 회사가 성숙해지고 규모를 확장하는 결정적인 계기가 됩니다.`,
    12: `팀이 더 많은 책임을 맡게 되면서, 인덕토썸은 직원들을 데일 카네기 코스에 등록시키는 등 영업 전문성에 집중합니다. 거대 기업 에이잭스와 차별화하기 위해 로이 루블은 대담한 전략을 제안합니다. 바로 경쟁사보다 가격을 10% 인상하여 우수한 품질과 기술력을 과시하는 것입니다. 놀랍게도 이 전략은 적중하여 시장 점유율이 상승합니다. 에이잭스는 이에 맞서 무자비한 가격 전쟁을 선포하며 노골적으로 가격을 깎습니다. 로완은 물러서는 대신 가격 인하에 맞불을 놓아 시장 점유율을 방어하고, 낮은 운영 비용을 바탕으로 버텨냅니다. 이 소모전은 인덕토썸의 수익에 타격을 주었지만, 비대해진 에이잭스에게는 치명타가 되어 결국 에이잭스의 매각으로 이어집니다.`,
    13: `에이잭스 일렉트로써믹은 마그네써믹(Magnethermic)에 인수됩니다. 새로운 오너인 존 로건은 로완을 저녁 식사에 초대하여, 인덕토썸을 "그냥 놔두고" 에이잭스 부문을 맡아달라는 대담한 제안을 합니다. 로완은 자신의 회사를 과소평가하는 로건의 태도에 헛웃음을 지으며 거절합니다. 그러나 진짜 위협이 등장합니다. 에이잭스가 전동 발전기가 필요 없는 정지형 주파수 체배기인 "멀티덕터(Multiductor, 180사이클)"를 출시한 것입니다. 고객들이 인덕토썸의 전동 발전기 시스템 대신 이 신기술을 선택하기 시작합니다. 로완은 생존을 위해 관련 기술 경험이 전무함에도 불구하고 즉시 독자적인 정지형 주파수 체배기를 개발해야 함을 깨닫습니다. 공백을 메우기 위해 그들은 용해로 렌털 프로그램을 도입합니다.`,
    14: `에이잭스와 마그네써믹의 합병 과정에서 소외된 핵심 인재들이 인덕토썸으로 넘어오게 됩니다. 로완이 에이잭스 시절 존경했던 천재 엔지니어 테드 케네디는 로건에게 해고된 후 인덕토썸에 합류하여 방대한 이론적 지식을 전수합니다. 또한 채널 용해로 전문가인 짐 호프와 알 콜리는 오하이오로의 이전을 거부합니다. 로완은 이들에게 자금을 지원하여 대형 채널 용해로를 제작하는 자회사 '인덕토썸 라인멜트(Inductotherm Linemelt)'를 설립하게 합니다. 이는 제품 라인업을 다양화하는 계기가 됩니다. 호프는 이론적 한계를 뛰어넘는 고출력 장비를 제작하며 업계의 통념에 도전합니다. 이러한 인재 유입은 멀티덕터가 제기한 기술적 과제를 해결할 기반이 됩니다.`,
    15: `멀티덕터와 경쟁하기 위해 필사적이었던 로완은 관련 기술을 안다고 주장하는 래리 헤이즈를 고용합니다. 로완은 시웨이 니켈(Seaway Nickel)을 위해 6주 안에 500kW급 "트라이 라인(Tri-Line)" 시스템을 제작하는 프로젝트에 회사의 운명을 겁니다. 그러나 헤이즈는 훔친 도면을 가진 사기꾼임이 드러납니다. 로완과 테드 케네디는 기초 물리학을 바탕으로 밤을 새워가며 시스템을 처음부터 다시 설계합니다. 그들은 기한을 맞추고 트라이 라인은 성공적으로 작동합니다. 하지만 에이잭스는 회로에 사용된 "초크(chokes)"에 대해 특허 소송을 제기하며 위협합니다. 인덕토썸은 굴복하거나 로열티를 지불하는 대신, 특허를 우회하는 우수한 토로이달 코어 설계를 개발하여 180사이클 용해 분야의 주도권을 확보합니다.`,
    16: `1960년, 인덕토썸은 델란코 공장이 비좁을 정도로 성장합니다. 로완은 랭코카스(Rancocas)에 90에이커의 농장을 매입하여 활주로를 갖춘 현대식 시설을 짓습니다. 그러나 확장은 재정에 부담을 줍니다. 갑자기 은행이 리스 자금으로 단기 대출을 사용했다는 이유를 들어 50만 달러의 대출금 즉시 상환을 요구합니다. 자금 위기에 직면한 로완과 루블은 리스 고객들에게 용해로 소유권을 제안하며 구매자로 전환시키는 기지를 발휘합니다. 그들은 기록적인 시간 안에 자금을 모아 은행 빚을 갚습니다. 이 경험은 은행에 대한 로완의 불신을 굳히고 재정적 독립에 대한 철학을 강화하는 계기가 됩니다. 랭코카스로의 이전은 대규모 성장의 발판이 됩니다.`,
    17: `로완은 알레그니 러들럼(Allegheny Ludlum)에서 해고된 뛰어나지만 기이한 영국 엔지니어 J 우딩을 만납니다. 그들은 항공우주 합금에 필수적인 진공 아크 용해 시장에 진출하기 위해 합작 회사 콘사크(Consarc)를 설립합니다. 로완은 우딩에게 50%의 지분을 주는 치명적인 실수를 저지릅니다. 콘사크는 기술적으로 성공하지만, 우딩의 행동은 점점 더 변덕스럽고 사치스러워집니다. 그는 과도한 혜택을 요구하고 재무 담당 밥 호치킨과 충돌하며, 오만함으로 고객들을 멀어지게 합니다. 우딩의 지출과 경영 스타일은 인덕토썸의 검소한 문화와 격렬하게 충돌합니다. 파트너십은 권력 다툼으로 변질되고, 로완은 공동 경영의 위험성과 사업 파트너의 인품이 얼마나 중요한지에 대해 뼈저린 교훈을 얻습니다.`,
    18: `인덕토썸은 1960년대에 급성장하여 1967년 매출 1,500만 달러를 달성합니다. 영업 및 서비스 직원들이 회사 비행기를 타고 고객을 찾아가는 등 항공은 기업 문화의 핵심이 됩니다. 로완은 전문 비서 줄리아 그린해프를 고용하여 혼란스러웠던 사무실에 질서를 잡습니다. 회사가 성장하자 노조 조직가들이 접근합니다. 투표를 앞두고 로완은 위협 대신 회사의 독특한 문화와 이익 공유 신탁의 가치를 소통하며 맞섭니다. 직원들은 경영진과의 직접적인 관계를 소중히 여겨 압도적인 표 차(2.4 대 1)로 노조 결성을 거부합니다. 이 승리는 '인덕토썸 가족' 정신을 더욱 공고히 합니다.`,
    19: `환경 규제로 인해 코크스를 사용하는 큐폴라(cupola)가 퇴출되면서 주철 주조 공장들은 유도 용해로로 전환해야 했습니다. 스위스의 거대 기업 브라운 보베리(Brown Boveri)가 대형 60사이클 용해로 시장을 장악하고 있었습니다. 인덕토썸은 고전하다가 테드 케네디가 토로이달 리액터를 이용한 무단계 전력 제어 장치인 "유니코일(Unicoil)"을 발명하면서 반격에 나섭니다. 이 혁신으로 주철 시장을 장악하게 됩니다. 이후 새로운 미국 조폐국 프로젝트는 브라운 보베리 사양을 선호하는 컨설턴트들에 의해 설계되었습니다. 인덕토썸은 입찰을 따냈지만 결함이 있는 설계대로 제작해야만 했습니다. 로완의 예상대로 용해로가 고장 나자, 그는 자신의 설계로 다시 제작하여 정부에 인덕토썸의 기술적 우위를 입증해 보입니다.`,
    20: `현금 보유고가 늘어나자 로완은 인덕토썸 인더스트리를 다각화합니다. 그의 전략은 소규모 벤처 기업들을 인수한 뒤 전통적인 대기업 방식으로 관리하는 대신 자본을 지원해 성장을 돕는 것이었습니다. 펨버턴 패브리케이터스(철강), 밸리 메탈스(공급) 등은 소유주들이 합류를 원해 인수했습니다. 그는 크래그멧(진공 용해)을 인수하며 개성 강한 지미 멧칼프를 영입했고, IPE(유도 가열, 훗날 Inductoheat)도 사들였습니다. 목표는 각 자회사의 기업가 정신을 유지하는 것이었습니다. 로완은 중앙집권화보다 전문화가 더 효과적임을 깨닫습니다. 이 시기는 단일 용해로 회사에서 다양한 산업 그룹으로 전환하는 중요한 시점이 됩니다.`,
    21: `반도체 소자(SCR)가 전동 발전기를 대체하기 시작합니다. 자체 기술이 부족했던 인덕토썸은 필라(Pillar)와 제휴하여 "VIP" 인버터를 제작합니다. 이는 대성공을 거두며 전동 발전기를 구시대의 유물로 만듭니다. 그러나 필라는 독점 계약을 어기고 경쟁사들에게 제품을 판매하며 배신합니다. 로완은 필라와 결별하고 자회사 IPE의 바이런 테일러에게 자체 인버터 개발을 맡깁니다. 테일러는 Mark II와 이후 효율성과 "퓨즈 없는" 신뢰성을 갖춘 "파워 트랙(Power-Trak)" 개발에 성공합니다. 이로써 인덕토썸은 반도체 시대에 독립성과 리더십을 확보하게 되고, 필라와 다른 경쟁사들을 따돌리며 시장 지배력을 공고히 합니다.`,
    22: `1968년 8월, 오랫동안 예견되었던 비극이 닥칩니다. 로완은 아들 지미가 위독하다는 전화를 받습니다. 그는 가족이 있는 레이크 조지로 급히 날아가지만, 지미는 그가 도착하기 전 21살의 나이로 세상을 떠납니다. 슬픔은 깊었습니다. 로완은 아들의 용기와 병마로 인해 꺾인 잠재력을 되새깁니다. 이 상실감으로 인해 로완은 슬픔을 잊기 위해 더욱 일에 몰두하게 되고, 개인적인 고통을 이겨내려는 듯 회사를 더욱 강력하게 이끌어 나갑니다. 이는 사업적 성공도 개인적인 비극을 치유할 수는 없음을 보여주는 안타까운 순간이었습니다.`,
    23: `인덕토썸은 해외 시장으로 공격적으로 진출합니다. 제스 카트리지는 호주로 파견되어 맨바닥에서 자회사를 시작합니다. 그는 현지 생산과 탁월한 서비스를 통해 현지 시장을 장악합니다. 회사는 멕시코와 브라질로도 확장합니다. 브라질 합작 투자는 파트너가 선급금을 탕진하는 등 초기에 난항을 겪었으나, 헨크 로퍼가 파견되어 회생시킵니다. 로퍼는 근면과 성실이라는 인덕토썸의 문화를 심어 브라질 자회사를 성공시킵니다. 이 시기를 통해 인덕토썸은 기술뿐만 아니라 독특한 기업 문화까지 수출하는 진정한 다국적 기업으로 자리매김합니다.`,
    24: `영국 자회사인 메탈렉트릭(Metalectric)은 경영 부실과 노사 간 계급 갈등으로 막대한 손실을 보고 있었습니다. 로완은 비윤리적인 행위를 한 경영 이사를 해고하고 호주에 있던 제스 카트리지를 영국으로 보냅니다. 제스는 공장에서 소매를 걷어붙이고 일하고 펍에서 노동자들과 술잔을 기울이며 계급 장벽을 허 뭅니다. 그는 사명을 인덕토썸 유럽으로 변경하고 팀워크 정신을 불어넣습니다. 회생은 극적이었습니다. 회사는 높은 수익을 내게 되었고 권위 있는 '영국 여왕상(Queen’s Award to Industry)'을 수상합니다. 제스의 성공은 인덕토썸의 철학이 문화적 경계를 넘어설 수 있음을 증명했습니다.`,
    25: `로완은 성공이 안이함을 낳을까 우려합니다. 경쟁사에게 직접 판매를 시작한 필라와의 갈등은 필요한 충격 요법이 됩니다. 인덕토썸은 즉시 자체 반도체 기술을 개발해야 하는 상황에 놓입니다. 자회사 IPE의 바이런 테일러는 앞서 저예산으로 "샤잠(Shazaam)" 인버터를 개발해 자신의 자리를 지킨 바 있었습니다. 로완은 테일러를 랭코카스로 불러 용해용 인버터 설계를 맡깁니다. 그 결과 탄생한 Mark II와 이후의 파워 트랙(Power-Trak)은 효율을 95%까지 끌어올린 기술적 도약이었습니다. 이 위기는 회사에 활력을 불어넣었고, 신속하고 혁신적인 대응 능력을 입증했습니다. 필라와의 결별은 결과적으로 인덕토썸을 더 강하게 만들었습니다.`,
    26: `콘사크의 J 우딩으로 인한 상황은 더 이상 묵과할 수 없게 됩니다. 우딩의 자존심, 사치, 소송을 일삼는 성향은 회사를 파멸로 몰고 갑니다. 그는 고객을 멀어지게 하고, 가상의 적을 고소하며, 직원을 학대합니다. 로완은 파산 위기의 자회사를 구하기 위해 지분 55%를 확보하여 경영권을 장악합니다. 신부와 변호사들까지 동원된 드라마 같은 이사회에서 우딩은 축출됩니다. 우딩은 소송을 제기하여 긴 법정 공방이 이어지지만, 법원은 결국 매수 방식의 정당성을 인정합니다. 우딩이 떠난 후 스탠 마이어스가 취임하여 콘사크의 안정과 수익성을 회복시킵니다. 이 '엑소시즘'은 유해한 영향을 제거하여 자회사가 다시 번창할 수 있게 했습니다.`,
    27: `로완은 오랜 기간 자신의 오른팔이자 인덕토썸 법인 사장이었던 로이 루블에게 경의를 표합니다. 루블의 규율 있는 경영, 정직함, 가격 전략은 회사 성장의 중추적인 역할을 했습니다. 그는 탁월한 협상가이자 영업팀의 멘토였습니다. 안타깝게도 루블은 1984년 암으로 세상을 떠납니다. 후임으로 루블은 인덕토썸 호주의 대표였던 존 모티머를 지목해 두었습니다. 모티머는 공장에 에어컨을 설치하고 경영진과 직원 간의 장벽을 없애는 등 보다 개방적인 경영 스타일을 도입합니다. 영업 부문의 폴 서벨레로의 지원을 받아 모티머는 회사의 성장을 이어갑니다. 로완은 새로운 리더십을 신뢰하며 지주 회사 경영으로 물러납니다.`,
    28: `인덕토썸 인더스트리는 마그네틱 메탈스, 밴티지 프로덕츠, 레펠 등 다양한 기업을 인수하며 확장 전략을 가속화합니다. 로완은 투명한 재무 차트 시스템을 이용해 이 거대한 제국을 관리합니다. 대부분의 인수 기업이 번창했지만, 개입이 필요한 경우도 있었습니다. SMS의 제리 시코네는 횡령 혐의로 해고되어 수감되었습니다. IPE(후에 Inductoheat)에서는 수익을 내지 못하던 빌 페셸 대신 바이런 테일러가 임명되었습니다. 테일러는 관료주의를 타파하고 성과 중심 문화를 만들었으며, 기업용 항공기를 활용해 매출을 증대시켰습니다. 테일러의 지휘 아래 인덕토히트는 세계적인 리더로 성장합니다. 지주 회사는 대기업으로 성장했지만, 여전히 자율적인 기업가 정신을 중시합니다.`,
    29: `제스 카트리지는 자신의 마지막이자 가장 힘든 임무인 인덕토썸 재팬 설립을 맡습니다. 막대한 비용(월세 4,000달러)과 배타적인 비즈니스 문화에 맞서 제스는 굴하지 않습니다. 그는 일본어를 배우고 작업복을 입고 직원을 교육하며 문화적 관행을 깹니다. 미쓰비시나 신코 덴키 같은 현지 경쟁사들은 그를 몰아내기 위해 가격을 대폭 인하합니다. 그러나 인덕토썸의 우수한 기술(파워 트랙)과 서비스는 결국 시장을 사로잡습니다. 미쓰비시는 결국 용해로 사업에서 철수하고, 인덕토썸 재팬은 주요 기업으로 부상합니다. 아시아 제조업의 심장부에서 거둔 이 승리로 인덕토썸의 글로벌 지배력이 완성됩니다.`,
    30: `1978년 12월, 다시 한번 비극이 닥칩니다. 로완의 둘째 아들 데이비드가 28세의 나이로 근이영양증으로 세상을 떠납니다. 휠체어에 의지해야 했음에도 데이비드는 그림을 그리고 전자기기를 조립하며 CB 무전기로 세상과 소통하는 등 지적으로 풍요로운 삶을 살았습니다. 가족에게는 엄청난 상실이었습니다. 지미가 떠난 지 10년 만에 닥친 이 일은 병마와의 길고 고통스러웠던 싸움의 끝을 의미했습니다. 이 사건은 로완에게 사업적 성공이 보람되긴 하지만, 가장 깊은 개인적 상실까지 막아줄 수는 없음을 다시금 일깨워 주었습니다.`,
    31: `로완은 인도의 막대한 잠재력에 주목합니다. 초기의 직접 판매는 관료주의와 부패로 얼룩졌지만, 인덕토썸은 이에 타협하기를 거부합니다. 전 대리점 직원 쿠마르 하브는 경쟁사로 이직하며 회사를 배신하기도 했습니다. 마침내 로완은 인덕토썸의 설계를 모방해 자신의 회사를 차린 인도 엔지니어 키쇼어 비아스를 만납니다. 비아스의 정직함과 끈기에 감명받은 로완은 합작 투자로 인덕토썸 인디아를 설립합니다. 정부 규제에도 불구하고, 높은 윤리 기준과 현대 기술 도입을 통해 합작사는 성공을 거둡니다. 이 회사는 인도의 주조 산업 현대화를 돕고, 스테인리스 식기 같은 필수품 생산에 기여합니다.`,
    32: `로완은 글로벌 확장의 위험성과 복잡성에 대해 회고합니다. 마스터플랜은 없었지만, 결단력 있는 행동으로 인덕토썸은 세계 최대 용해로 제조업체가 되었습니다. 그러나 성공은 새로운 위험, 특히 정치적 위험을 불러왔습니다. 이 챕터는 콘사크와 관련된 주요 지정학적 갈등의 서막입니다. 지미 멧칼프가 이끄는 콘사크가 소련에 진공 용해로를 판매한 사건을 다룹니다. 초기에는 승인되었으나, 정보기관이 이 용해로가 미사일 노즈콘용 "카본-카본" 제조에 쓰일 것이라 의심하면서 논란이 됩니다. 로완은 결국 멧칼프에게 프로젝트 중단을 지시하고, 이는 멧칼프의 사임으로 이어집니다.`,
    33: `콘사크는 의료용 보철물 제작을 위해 이라크에 전자빔 용해로를 판매하는 계약을 체결합니다. 미국 상무부도 판매를 승인했습니다. 그러나 걸프전 직전 지정학적 상황이 변하면서 백악관은 핵무기 개발 우려를 이유로 선적을 막습니다. 언론은 콘사크를 "기술 도적(technobandits)"이라며 비난합니다. 로완은 정부의 말 바꾸기와 언론의 왜곡에 분노합니다. 그는 이라크 정부를 계약 위반으로 고소하여 승소 판결(실제 회수는 불가능했지만)을 받아냅니다. 이 사건은 첨단 기술 수출의 위험성을 보여주었고, 로완은 합법적 사업에 대한 정부의 처사에 씁쓸함을 느꼈지만, 콘사크는 결국 계약금을 지킬 수 있었습니다.`,
    34: `1990년, 기금 모금가 필 투미니아가 글래스보로 주립대학(Glassboro State College)에 대한 기부를 요청하며 로완에게 접근합니다. 로완은 처음에는 1,500달러라는 상징적인 금액만 기부했지만, 투미니아와 우정을 쌓게 됩니다. 투미니아가 도서관 건립 기금을 요청하자 로완은 거절하며 공학 교육에만 관심이 있다고 밝힙니다. 결국 투미니아는 1억 달러가 있다면 학교가 무엇을 할 수 있을지 가정하여 묻습니다. 새로운 도전을 찾고 뉴저지에 보답하고자 했던 로완은 공립 대학 역사상 최대 규모인 1억 달러를 기부하기로 결심합니다. 유일한 조건은 최고 수준의 공과 대학 설립이었습니다. 학교는 이에 동의하고 교명을 로완 대학(Rowan College)으로 변경하기로 합니다.`,
    35: `1억 달러 기부 발표는 언론의 뜨거운 관심을 불러일으킵니다. 그러나 논란도 뒤따릅니다. 졸업생들은 교명 변경에 대해 소송을 제기하고, 노조는 별도 협상 없이는 단체 교섭 대상자를 제외하는 장학금 조항을 공격합니다. 언론은 로완을 이기주의자이자 노조 파괴자로 묘사합니다. 로완은 기자 회견을 열어 교육 환경 개선이라는 자신의 순수하고 조건 없는 의도를 명확히 밝힙니다. 논란은 가라앉고 기금 전달이 시작됩니다. 에필로그에서 그는 자신의 삶, 아들들을 잃은 슬픔, 딸 지니와 회사의 성공, 그리고 여전히 식지 않는 도전에 대한 열망을 회고합니다. 그의 '내면의 불꽃(The Fire Within)'은 여전히 타오르고 있습니다.`,

    1: "這些摘錄概述了敘述者早年的成長經歷，他是一位著名醫生的兒子，母親則堅信自力更生，其童年在家鄉新澤西州度過。重大轉捩點發生在他六歲時，當時父母在1930年突然且未經解釋的離婚，使他多年來充滿疑問，並渴望證明自己的價值。他的母親在經歷1929年股災後特別注重紀律和節儉，透過嚴格的帳目管理、旅行以及早期的企業家精神來培養他的自立能力。儘管他立志攻讀工程學，但他在珍珠港事件後中斷學業，作為二戰轟炸機飛行員加入陸軍航空隊，藉此獲得了書本外的廣泛經驗。戰爭結束後，他終於找到生父並與之對質，得知了離婚背後真正的緣由，消除了長達十四年來困擾他的不確定感，但對自我成就的追求仍然持續。",
    2: "文本記載了敘述者在就讀麻省理工學院（MIT）時，同時撫養年幼家庭的艱辛歷程。他們帶著有限的積蓄抵達劍橋，夫妻倆仔細規劃，依靠嚴格的財務管理、種植糧食和組織食物合作社，將每月的家庭開支控制在135美元以下，過著拮据的生活。在學術上，麻省理工學院的課程極為嚴苛，每週需要投入90小時進行學習，促使學生培養對技術和經濟的創業理解力。儘管在學期間育有兩名子女，壓力重重，敘述者仍以優異成績畢業，獲得電機工程專業的最高榮譽。畢業後，他立即獲得了感應爐領域的領軍企業Ajax Electrothermic的工作機會，並成功地將原始儲蓄撐過了整個二十個月的學業期。",

    6: "文本追溯了漢克·羅文（Hank Rowan）從不滿意的企業工作轉變為接受海軍製造與供應公司（Marine Manufacturing & Supply Co.）的挑戰職位，他在那裡通過現代化設備運營（效率提高高達16倍），扭轉了巨額財務虧損，最終晉升為工廠經理。在取得成功並拒絕了來自Magnethermic的工作邀約後，羅文被Harcast的Paul Foley說服，以500美元的價格作為兼職項目建造一個熔爐。這項合作促成了Inductotherm在1953年5月的成立，羅文為其首款產品實施了創新的工程解決方案，例如使用鋼筋澆鑄耐火混凝土底座。由於海軍製造公司的業務在朝鮮停戰協定後大幅下滑，羅文於1954年6月毅然決定辭職，全職投入Inductotherm，擔任首席執行官、總工程師和半個所有者，儘管當時公司沒有訂單且僅依靠他的個人儲蓄維持。這家新公司在Harcast工廠的一角艱難運營，透過銷售線圈、坩堝和零件生存，並設法獲得了幾個重要的小額初始合約，彰顯了新創企業在既有市場中競爭所面臨的巨大挑戰。 ",
    7: "這段文字詳細描述了 Inductotherm 成立初期充滿挑戰的一年，公司在失去一份關鍵合約後陷入絕境，被迫解僱員工並依靠合夥人的個人資金維繫營運。直到一筆來自奇異電氣 (GE) 的訂單為他們奠定了基礎，讓他們得以向市場展示技術實力。藉助這份信譽，公司贏得了美國鑄幣廠 (U.S. Mint) 的重要項目，成功擊敗了老牌競爭者。隨後，他們贏得了最初失去的大型熔爐合約，但卻必須克服銀行拒絕提供營運資金的重大融資困境，最終透過創辦人及其妻子的個人擔保才取得零件。創辦人設計了一種緊湊高效的創新系統，成功完成安裝，最終在第一財年以71,000 美元的銷售額和微薄的利潤結束，證明了企業的生存能力與成長潛力。   ",
    8: "該文本描述了 Inductotherm 快速發展的早期階段，透過獲得 Henry Kawecki 等主要客戶的訂單，並在極度擁擠的空間中證明了其高品質產品，從而建立起商業信譽。由於對更大空間的需求，創始人的妻子 Betty 最終在 Delanco 找到了一處合適的廠房，同時公司招募了關鍵人才，例如資深技工 Dick Walker，創始人承諾他未來有機會成為一名 百萬富翁。儘管銷售額在兩年內暴增了 300%，但創始人對於快速擴張和承擔風險的渴望，與合夥人 Paul 傾向於維持 現狀 且分心於其他業務的態度產生了根本的衝突。這種分歧促使 Paul 提出退出，並同意以會計師 Bob Hotchkin 評估的 $52,500 價格出售他 50% 的股權。由於創始人缺乏流動資金，Paul 提出了一項慷慨的 槓桿收購 條款，允許創始人僅支付 $10,000 頭期款，使其得以獨自擁有公司，但也帶來了對巨大成功或徹底失敗的風險與孤獨感。 ",
    9: "文本記述了 Inductotherm 快速成長與文化奠定的關鍵時期，特別提到團隊僅用四天就完成了原本需要六週的 175 kW 控制櫃 建造任務，成功打破了既定的時間限制。隨著公司收入翻倍，創辦人積極引進人才，包括負責採購的 Tom Pippitt 與主導銷售和組織結構的 Roy Ruble。 Ruble 挑戰了舊有的成本定價法，教導創辦人必須依據 市場價值來制定價格，才能反映其優越工作的真正利潤。 為了進一步激勵員工並培養主人翁精神，公司在其會計師的建議下，採用了當時極為先進的 利潤分享信託制度，將所有員工的努力與公司的長期成功相互連結。",
    10: "文本記述了Inductotherm成長中的關鍵時刻，始於Crucible Steel真空熔爐發生的災難性爆炸，該事件使高價值飛機超級合金的生產陷入停滯。作者Hank緊急動用他的私人二手Ercoupe飛機，飛行四百英里趕往現場，展現了私人航空為公司帶來的競爭優勢。在現場，他提出了一種創新且極度簡化的熔爐電源接入設計，使Inductotherm得以大幅降低成本並獲得兩台更大的、最先進的3,000磅熔爐訂單。這次成功立即使Inductotherm在新興且要求嚴苛的真空熔煉技術領域站穩腳跟，該技術對噴射發動機零件至關重要。資料進一步說明，持續使用飛機（包括升級到更快的Bellanca）如何成為其業務戰略不可或缺的一部分，證實最初的投資通過向Corning Glass等客戶進行的重大銷售迅速回本。最終，私人飛行使該公司能夠提供專業且及時的解決方案，即使是在早期民用航空的原始條件下。 ",
    11: "這段摘錄自《內心的火焰》，描述了作者作為一家迅速擴張的感應爐製造公司的負責人，面臨巨大的專業和個人挑戰。在公司追求百萬營收的同時，敘事者失去了他最依賴的關鍵人物傑瑞·沃拉斯頓，這場悲劇性的車禍使公司失去了主心骨，迫使他將所有重擔一肩扛起。更為沉重的壓力來自於家裡，他的兩個兒子正與進行性肌營養不良症抗爭，這迫使他將深切的悲痛轉化為對工作的極度微觀管理和專斷。這種無法承受的壓力最終導致敘事者在辦公室崩潰，無法繼續工作。在他的妻子貝蒂的勸說下，他決定向他的核心團隊坦白他的個人困境和瀕臨崩潰的狀態。透過這份坦誠，他學會了授權和接受幫助，將領導方式從獨自承擔的「苦行」轉變為共同承擔的責任，迎來了公司和個人生活的新篇章。",
    12: " 這段摘錄自《扭轉龍尾》的文字描述了敘述者（同時是 Inductotherm 的首席執行官）的公司在 1950 年代後期面臨的重大挑戰與戰略轉變。雖然公司擁有傑出的工程設計和訓練有素的員工，但由於銷售策略存在不足，他們難以將詢問轉化為訂單。為解決這一問題，公司於 1958 年投資進行了 戴爾·卡內基銷售培訓課程，此舉幫助員工從單純注重技術轉向關注勸說技巧與客戶利益。然而，真正的突破來自於推銷員羅伊·魯布爾提出的激進建議：將價格提高到比競爭對手 高出 10% 的水平。魯布爾認為，報價過低會暗示產品質量低劣，而提高價格則反映了 Inductotherm 熔爐的真正價值和優勢。這一高價策略非但沒有阻礙銷售，反而使訂單量 顯著增加，成功地喚醒並激怒了長期佔據市場主導地位的競爭對手 Ajax。",
    13: "本文記錄了敘事者（Inductotherm）如何應對主要競爭對手 Ajax Electrothermic 的激烈挑戰，後者首先推出了一項革命性的新技術。這種名為「Multiductor」的先進感應爐系統，對 Inductotherm 構成生存威脅；隨後，Ajax 更實施了不計成本的削價競爭策略。為求生存並吸引缺乏資本的客戶，敘事者的團隊轉而開創了感應爐租賃計劃，有效地抵消了競爭對手的價格戰。由於 Inductotherm 保持了精益運營和創新，Ajax 卻因其價格戰策略損失慘重，最終導致該公司被 Magnethermic 收購。收購完成後，新東家試圖招募敘事者來經營併購後的部門，但這項不切實際的提議遭到了拒絕。",
    14: "文本記載了 Inductotherm 如何透過吸納被主要競爭對手 Ajax Magnethermic 淘汰的核心人才，實現策略性擴張。Inductotherm 的領導人 Hank Rowan 在 Ted Kennedy 於 1959 年被 Ajax 孤立並解僱後，將這位工程天才招至麾下。此外，Inductotherm 利用 Ajax 搬遷所導致的人員流失，招攬了拒絕遷往俄亥俄州的鐵芯爐專家 Jim Hoff 和 Al Coley。這些熔溝爐專家獲得了資金支持，成立了新的子公司 Inductotherm Linemelt Corporation，而 Inductotherm 則保留了多數股權。這個新團隊迅速開始挑戰既有的行業限制，在熔溝爐領域開創了更高的功率標準，進而擴大了 Inductotherm 的市場範圍。 ",
    15: "這段文字描述了 Inductotherm 公司面對的嚴重競爭危機，當時其主要競爭對手 Ajax Magnethermic 正藉由名為「Multiductor」的新型 180 週期變頻器技術搶佔市場。由於 Inductotherm 缺乏可與之抗衡的產品，導致市場份額急劇流失，甚至失去了一筆來自客戶 Ivan Kurzner 的關鍵訂單。在極度絕望之下，該公司領導者做出了高風險決定，承諾在短短六週內設計並交付一套 500 kW 變頻器和大型熔爐系統，並同意支付高額的延遲罰金。儘管後來發現其聘請的技術專家並不可靠，但 Inductotherm 的工程團隊仍透過對舊有專利的緊急研究，成功發明了他們自己的新系統。經過五週半的艱苦工作和巨大的物流挑戰，這套名為 「TRI-LINE」 的設備最終按時安裝並成功熔化了鎳，挽救了公司的命運。這個技術突破不僅使 Inductotherm 得以生存，也為該公司創造了奠基性的產品線。 ",
    16: "該文摘錄詳細描述了 Inductotherm 公司在 1960 年代初期經歷的一系列嚴峻挑戰，包括迅速擴張、財務危機和專利訴訟。公司為應對高速增長而遷至 Rancocas 建造了大型新廠房，但此舉使其承擔了巨大的債務風險。在搬遷之後，一次銀行合併導致其面臨突然的 五十萬美元貸款催收危機，迫使管理層緊急尋求外部融資並依賴客戶提前買斷租賃設備。就在財務壓力緩解之際，主要競爭對手 Ajax Magnethermic 又發起了 專利侵權訴訟，試圖阻止 Inductotherm 生產其核心產品 TRI-LINE 三倍頻熔爐。面對法律困境，公司決定在技術上超越對手，成功研發出 不構成侵權的下一代三倍頻系統。這項技術勝利最終迫使 Ajax 放棄了訴訟，鞏固了 Inductotherm 在市場上的主導地位，並確保了其 TRI-LINE 產品線 的長期成功。 ",
    17: "這段文字摘錄自回憶錄，講述了 Inductotherm 創立子公司 Consarc 的經歷，該公司專注於製造對航空航太業至關重要的真空電弧熔煉設備。敘述者與極具才華但行為怪異的英國工程師 J Wooding 建立了各佔百分之五十的合資企業，希望利用他在該領域的專業知識來開拓新市場。儘管 Wooding 憑藉其出色的銷售技巧使 Consarc 的收入迅速增長並獲得了市場領先地位，但他極度傲慢、奢侈浪費，並蔑視母公司奉行的節儉原則。公司會計部門必須處理他高額的個人費用，例如租用私人飛機和虛構的商務旅行，最終揭露了他謊言成性的本性。他的高壓和刻薄行為，包括公開羞辱員工，體現了他那種渴望引人注目和嘲諷他人的強烈衝動，這使公司內部關係陷入緊張，並最終開始損害外部的客戶關係。 ",
    18: "該文獻概述了 Inductotherm 公司在 1960 年代初期的迅速成長，其營收大幅增加，並以 NINE-LINE 感應熔爐等創新產品鞏固了其在行業內的領先地位。為了更好地服務客戶，許多高階銷售和服務人員都開始學習駕駛飛機，而公司也終於聘請到了能勝任其執行秘書職位的得力助手 Julia Greenhalgh。在國內，管理層積極應對勞工運動的挑戰，成功挫敗了數次由 International Union of Electrical Workers 等工會發起的組織投票，強調公司提供的優厚 利潤分享信託 計畫。雖然公司在菲律賓市場取得了顯著的銷售成功，但其向歐洲廠商授予的技術許可卻因執行不力而以失敗告終。鑒於此，首席執行官最終拒絕了與強大的潛在競爭對手，例如瑞典的 ASEA 或日本的 Shinko Denki，進行授權合作，決定將保護專有技術置於追求快速授權利潤之上。 ",
    19: "本文概述了二十世紀六十年代美國鑄造業因環境法規要求，從污染嚴重的傳統熔鐵爐技術轉向更清潔、更高效的感應熔煉技術時，Inductotherm公司所面臨的挑戰。在這場轉型中，該公司難以與其體量龐大的瑞士競爭對手布朗·博韋里（Brown Boveri, BBC）抗衡，後者在大型感應爐市場上佔據領先地位。作者詳細描述了兩項關鍵的道德困境：他拒絕向顧問公司支付回扣以換取獨家推薦，以及拒絕免費協助費城鑄幣廠撰寫設備規格。儘管這些堅持道義的決定最初導致Inductotherm錯失了數百萬美元的業務，但他們最終透過開發出色的UNICOIL無級控制系統來獲得競爭優勢。最後，文章講述了鑄幣廠按照有缺陷的規格安裝設備後迅速發生故障，迫使鑄幣廠最終採納Inductotherm最初建議的水冷式變壓器設計，證明了該公司的專業判斷。 ",
    20: "這些節選闡述了Inductotherm公司於六十年代中期開始實施的多元化和收購策略，其動機是基於核心業務的利潤飆升但市場規模有限。該公司在五年內銷售額翻了四倍，因此主要的商業理由是必須找到途徑將這些盈餘投入到新領域，以實現比單純將其存入銀行更快的加速增長。此外，作者作為CEO的「真正原因」是個人信念，即他渴望向有能力的創業者提供資本和新的挑戰，因為許多人一旦獲得了適度的成功便會停滯不前。Inductotherm的戰略著重於非敵意收購，範圍涵蓋相關領域到非相關行業，例如鈑金加工和電子元件製造，但始終保持創始人繼續管理子公司。透過收購如Pemberton Fabricators和專注於真空熔煉的Cragmet等公司，Inductotherm旨在結合這些專業知識與其自身追求成長和商業道德的原則。 ",
    21: "這段文本詳細介紹了 1966 年左右的關鍵時期，當時 Inductotherm 儘管在感應熔化市場處於領先地位，但預見到必須放棄舊有的電動發電機技術。這種老式電源昂貴且會導致癱瘓性的停機時間，因此迫切需要新興且高效的固態變頻器。由於缺乏內部專業知識，該公司與新創公司 Pillar, Inc. 合作開發核心組件。克服了重大障礙後，他們在 1968 年美國鑄造學會展覽會上成功推出了新系統 MARK I V.I.P.，鞏固了 Inductotherm 的主導地位，並迅速淘汰了電動發電機組。然而，這項成功也帶來了新的挑戰，因為複雜的新技術引發了嚴重的維護和維修問題，耗盡了 Inductotherm 的資源，並引起了人們對其長期依賴新合作夥伴 Pillar 的擔憂。 ",
    22: "這段文本節錄自一本回憶錄，詳細記述了敘述者在事業取得成功之際，面對的一場突如其來的個人悲劇。故事發生在 1968 年 8 月，敘述者接到電話得知他 二十一歲的兒子吉米 飽受疾病折磨，呼吸困難。儘管母親貝蒂試圖安慰他，但吉米似乎預知了自己的命運，在夜間過世。敘述者隨後迅速趕往 紐約州的喬治湖，與悲痛欲絕的家人會合，將這次旅程描述為一趟「悲傷的北上航班」。這篇章節以父親的沉痛反思作結，他認識到吉米雖然從長期的痛苦中解脫，但也失去了一個 充滿潛力、性格堅韌 的年輕生命。 ",
    23: "這些節選記述了 Inductotherm 公司在 1960 年代末至 1970 年代初的積極海外拓展歷程，標誌著其從原先的許可經營模式轉向直接建立子公司。在澳洲，公司透過合資成立 Inductotherm Australia，並由資深員工傑斯·卡特利奇（Jess Cartlidge）領導，最終獲得了完全所有權並佔據了當地市場的主導地位。為應對競爭對手在墨西哥的保護主義遊說，公司迅速設立了 Inductomex，但在初期合作夥伴的管理不善和員工背叛後，該公司不得不承擔起全面營運的責任。然而，進軍巴西市場時遭遇了重大挫折，因其選擇的本地合作夥伴出現了嚴重的資金濫用問題，導致 Inductotherm 必須中斷合作並進行人事調整。公司隨後派駐內部資深經理接手巴西業務，透過應用總部嚴格的生產和服務標準，最終使 Inductotherm 在這些新興市場中成功建立了領導地位。 ",
    24: "該文本詳細介紹了 Inductotherm 於 1970 年收購其英國許可經營商 Metalectric 後，為拯救這家不斷虧損的公司所進行的艱難轉型。該英國子公司面臨著諸如生產力低下、缺乏基本工具以及傳統階級制度造成的 勞資間缺乏溝通 等嚴重管理問題。在解僱了無效的原董事總經理之後，公司請來了在澳洲創造佳績的 傑斯·卡特利奇 來進行全面的文化和營運改造。卡特利奇透過採用 親力親為的管理模式，打破了階級隔閡，並教導員工們注重團隊合作精神和 Inductotherm 的工作標準。經過這次成功的改造，公司更名為 Inductotherm 歐洲有限公司，不僅及時交付訂單，還成功拓展了歐洲大陸的市場。這項轉型最終在 1976 年獲得了英國政府的最高認可，公司被授予 女王產業獎。 ",
    25: "原文本描述了 Inductotherm 領導人如何堅信對現狀的不滿足和激烈競爭是克服內部自滿情緒的動力，尤其是在他們憑藉 Mark I 固態電源供應器取得初步成功之後。然而，他們的獨家變頻器供應商 Pillar 違反了協議，不僅將技術授權給其他製造商，還宣布計劃直接進入熔爐製造市場，從根本上破壞了雙方的業務關係。面對這場危機，Inductotherm 終止了與 Pillar 的合作，並轉而利用其子公司 IPE 發起**「Shazaam 計劃」，旨在自行開發一種更可靠、更優越的固態變頻器。該計劃成功地創造出結構更簡單、體積更小的 Mark II 裝置，使 Inductotherm 能夠解決品質問題，隨後並發展出具有革命性無熔絲保護設計**的 Mark IV 供電裝置。通過這種內生性的技術創新，Inductotherm 成功地鞏固了其市場領導地位，而其前供應商 Pillar 則因技術停滯不前而淪為市場上的追隨者。 ",
    26: "這段摘錄記述了專業真空系統製造商 Consarc 內部曠日持久的企業鬥爭，詳細描述了其天賦異稟但性情不穩的執行長 J. Wooding 最終如何垮台。公司初期運營繁榮，但在六年後，由於 Wooding 對客戶和合作夥伴日益增長的傲慢、訴訟傾向和古怪行為，回頭客急劇下降，導致公司蒙受百萬美元的損失。敘述者作為 Wooding 平等的合夥人與 Inductotherm 的負責人，在 Consarc 遭受巨額虧損後，獲得了公司的多數股權並實施了「買賣協議」。當 Wooding 未能達到新的業績標準時，他必須辭職，並在一場有其律師和牧師出席的緊張董事會會議上被戲劇性地 免去總裁職務。隨後 Wooding 就收購價格提起訴訟，要求根據稅收損失得出虛高的價格，但法院最終裁定支持多數股東。最終，公司在新領導者的帶領下迅速穩定下來，銷售額和利潤都大幅增長，與動盪的 Wooding 時代形成了鮮明對比。 ",
    27: "這段文字詳細介紹了因公司大規模擴張和多元化，導致Inductotherm面臨的領導層職責調整。原任總裁辭去了核心業務的職務，以便專注於經營新成立的控股公司Inductotherm Industries, Inc.，該公司負責管理不斷增長的19家子公司。晉升迅速的Roy Ruble被任命為新的核心公司總裁，作者對其表現出高度讚揚，強調他的商業頭腦、道德誠信以及成功建立客戶關係的能力。Ruble的策略包括推行產品租賃方案和堅持優質定價，甚至在關鍵時刻代表客戶進行重要的國際談判。他的管理方法偏向於運用委派和組織，並透過數據儀表板而非親力親為來監督績效，此變革為公司帶來了顯著的成功",
    28: "該文本概述了Inductotherm Holding公司在創始人轉向收購和子公司管理後，如何經歷了快速且多樣化的擴張。該公司透過收購多家子公司，涉足了廣泛的領域，包括生產鎳鐵合金、裝飾性百葉窗以及設計航空電子顯示系統和數據採集終端。其經營理念是賦予子公司執行長們完全的營運自主權，但前提是他們必須達到透過嚴格的績效圖表所監測的標準。敘述對比了管理上的成功與失敗，例如其中一家子公司高管被發現貪污公款，而另一家苦苦掙扎的子公司則在Byron Taylor接手後實現了驚人的扭轉。Taylor透過削減官僚作風、專注於成本控制，並發明了技術先進的POWER-TRAK熔化變頻器，使公司迅速成長為感應加熱領域的全球領導者。 ",
    29: "該文本概述了 Inductotherm 公司在 1970 年代後期至 1980 年代初期，如何從一家美國本土企業轉變為全球性鑄造設備供應商的過程。儘管公司領導層之間，特別是推動全球擴張的 Jess Cartlidge 與注重利潤的 Roy Ruble 之間存在競爭性的哲學分歧，但他們都同意國際市場是公司未來的關鍵。Cartlidge 在重新組織了既有的海外業務並成功開拓了 南美市場 之後，將挑戰的重點轉向了充滿潛力的 日本，同時因智慧財產權和法規問題放棄了印度市場。於 1982 年建立 Inductotherm 日本 面臨了極高的房租和人力成本，並遭遇了日本本土「四大巨頭」利用傾銷手段來打壓市場的惡性競爭。然而，Cartlidge 堅守承諾，憑藉其更優異的爐體性能和卓越的 服務與支持，最終在五年內實現了銷售額的十倍增長，甚至迫使主要競爭對手 三菱 退出感應熔煉行業。 ",
    30: "這段文字出自《大衛：超越限制的成功》的節選，它首先對比了世俗衡量成功的標準——財富與勝利——與個人生命中更為重要的意義。作者的兒子大衛雖然終生受限於電動輪椅，但他擁有廣泛的興趣，對科學、技術和虛構冒險進行了大量的閱讀。儘管身體受到限制，大衛仍是一位多才多藝的人，他是一位專家級的談話者、一名優秀的油畫家，並且熱衷於製作電子設備套件，例如他的CB無線電，其呼號為「鋼鐵俠」。他傑出的天賦還體現在他能提出高效的生產解決方案上，他曾巧妙地指導父親用更簡單的方法製作鳥屋。然而，就在作者夫婦於1978年末因海外業務成功而旅行時，他們被緊急召回，隨後大衛在醫院去世，當時他年僅二十八歲。 ",
    31: "本文記述了 Inductotherm 公司在 1980 年代於印度建立合資企業，經歷挑戰但最終取得成功的故事。最初的努力受到當地的 官僚效率低下和體系性腐敗 所阻礙，其中包括客戶和代理人為規避高額關稅而進行的賄賂和欺騙行為。儘管外國股權被限制在 40%，且當地夥伴 Inductoheat 曾 抄襲 Inductotherm 的技術，但公司最終仍因欣賞其創始人的遠見卓識而確立了合作關係。該合資企業起初在定價策略上遭遇困難，但當他們堅持以 卓越的性能和品質 而非價格折扣進行銷售時，銷量便開始飆升。這種成長證明了印度市場對刀叉和水龍頭等基本現代商品有著巨大的未滿足需求，而這項事業的成功也擴大了產能並協助印度的鑄造業實現了現代化。 ",
    32: "該文概述了Inductotherm公司大膽的擴張戰略，它優先考慮果斷的行動，使其成為全球領先的感應爐製造商。該公司同時經歷了重大的領導層變革，詳細介紹了來自澳洲子公司的創新工程師約翰·莫蒂默（John Mortimer）被選為並最終擔任總裁的過程。然而，敘事焦點很快轉向子公司Consarc向蘇聯出售精密設備引發的國際危機。由於情報機構懷疑該設備被用於生產製造先進導彈技術至關重要的碳-碳材料，這項交易引發了英美兩國政府的緊急審查。在國際官僚機構的嚴重混亂和出口管制的矛盾指示下，該公司執行長最終單方面決定取消這份合同，以保護企業免受進一步的政治牽連。 ",
    33: "該文本記述了美國康薩克公司（Consarc）於1989年試圖向伊拉克出售先進熔爐的爭議事件，該交易最初的理據是提供 製造醫療義肢所需的設備。儘管該公司為此仔細地獲得了 美國商務部對出口的重複批准，但高管們私下裡仍感到擔憂，因為此類技術（例如電子束熔爐）同樣關鍵於 核子或彈道飛彈零件的製造。待熔爐於1990年製造完成並等待裝運時，政治風向突變，白宮出乎意料地採取行動，以國家安全為由推翻了先前的批准，阻止了這項涉及薩達姆·侯賽因武器計畫的交易。在這場出於政治考量的禁運之後，康薩克公司面臨負面輿論壓力，最終決定起訴伊拉克政府，指控其對購買目的進行了虛假陳述。雖然獲得了數額巨大但難以收回的賠償金，但該公司仍與本國政府產生分歧，因為美國政府隨後試圖以判決與 針對伊拉克的新經濟制裁 相衝突為由，推翻該裁決。 ",
    34: "這段文字摘錄自一位成功的企業家、漢克·羅文的回憶錄，記錄了他如何思索人生的下一階段以及如何處理其龐大的財富。儘管他的家族企業Inductotherm已由女兒和女婿接手，且他有充足的時間追求如駕駛里爾噴射機或參加奧運帆船選拔賽等愛好，羅文仍拒絕退休，並開始尋求一個能與他對製造業的終身熱忱相符的巨大挑戰。這個挑戰具體化在他與地方公立學校格拉斯伯勒州立學院的募款人接觸中；羅文向該校捐贈了小額款項後，表達了對美國過度關注商業學位的失望，並堅持應當著重於工業和技術工程教育。他拋出了一個假設性問題：該校若收到創紀錄的一億美元捐款將會如何使用，暗示了可能的大筆捐贈。雖然校方立刻提議將學校以他命名為羅文學院，但對於設立他所期望的全方位工程學院則顯得遲疑，並堅持需要進行冗長的可行性研究。 ",
    35: "這段文字敘述了亨利·羅文（Henry Rowan）決定向格拉斯伯勒州立學院承諾捐贈驚人的一億美元捐贈基金的複雜過程，此舉是出於慈善願望和創建一流工程學院的個人挑戰。在公開宣布之前，羅文必須處理其公司 Inductotherm 的財務壓力，並解決家人對繼承權的擔憂。當這項捐贈公佈且學院更名為羅文學院後，媒體和不滿的校友立即開始尋找「隱藏的動機」。這些審視加劇了羅文尋求個人榮耀或試圖透過員工獎學金計畫的特定結構進行打壓工會的指控。然而，羅文最終公開了最初的意向書，證明該禮物除了要求成立工程學院外沒有任何約束性條件，有效地平息了持續的負面揣測。",
    36: "該文摘描述了一位主要慈善家對羅文學院 (Rowan College)做出重大捐贈承諾後的個人經歷。儘管最初對於做出這筆巨額捐贈感到恐懼和焦慮，擔心這會成為難以承受的個人風險，但作者發現，此承諾反而帶來了巨大的個人收穫，並賦予了他的生活新的意義。該資金促進了工程學院的建立，並獲得了來自商業和學術界領袖組成的傑出國家諮詢委員會的支持，其中包括麻省理工學院的喬爾·摩西 (Joel Moses)。作者同時思考了他畢生的事業 Inductotherm，希望公司能夠繼續蓬勃發展，為後代年輕人帶來機會。他對家人的支持和始終理解與支持他的妻子**貝蒂 (Betty)**表達了感謝，並表明自己已經準備好迎接未來的挑戰。 ",
